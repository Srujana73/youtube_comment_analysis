*The future 00:30
*Avoiding climate catastrophy 01:20"
1,1,"Respect for Chris Anderson, he makes the talk pretty interesting, absolutely great job."
2,2,"That's one of the best interviews i saw. Besides the content, which is eye opening, Chris is asking really good questions and Elon is very comfortable answering them. "
3,3,One of the best Elon Musk interviews ever. The interviewer asked great pointed questions. He definitely did all his homework.
4,4,"This was the most amazing interview I have ever seen and listened to.

The substance of the topics, the sincerity, the humanness, and respect."
5,5,"This is one of the best elons interview i have seen in a long time. Outside of all the crazy stupid jokes and in the midst of all the negativism, this man gives me hope. I feel like in one way or other i can do something at my own scale atleast even if i get backlash."
6,6,"Genius his work is for the future of all humanity for decades for the generation and so on,
There’s so much more to come. The future of other planets is so important in protecting our own I feel like I'm mesmerised with every project and plan he focuses on as he puts 110% into everything, sleeps wherever he can may it be at friends or work, that’s dedication and believing in the future not only for him. As he said when he’s long gone so much more will be possible "
7,7,"I am very optimistic about the future, I'm sure in the end, I will wish that I had more time to see where we have come ."
8,8,"Not only a fascinating, intelligent interview, but also a sorely needed dose of optimism!!! (... for me, at least)"
9,9,There are so so many technologies hard to even fathom about it's a matter of getting them released. Much respect
10,10,I love the way he believes in the Ideas he and employees put work in. It feels like faith when said by him.
11,11,"Watching this video, I have to say that Chris Anderson is an outstanding and amazing interviewer. All questions were totally on point and not only interesting but also different to what we have heard before from Elon. Throughout the interview, one could see the underlying structure and guidance which made it easy to listen and follow along. And one thing that especially stood out: He rarely interrupted but still managed to get all the necessary information while not digressing from the main topics."
12,12,"What an amazing interview. Elon really is the Einstein of our time, and his genuine drive to move humanity forward is awe inspiring. This man deserves to live at least another hundred years. "
13,13,"""This is not in most people's heads"" is the statement of this interview that I have been thinking for a while but not said to Elon before I believe. That's an important concept to realize."
14,14,"The synergy Chris brings up is freakin awesome. No lie, Elon interviews are the most positive things to watch for
My own sanity. As of late :)"
15,15,"Elon will change the world, he's doing it already. The good thing is that his motivation is not only economical... but for good or bad, but he is the man of this century that will definitely change the world. Cheers from Argentina."
16,16,“I’ve been motivated by curiosity beyond anything .” - Elon Musk
17,17,This is really well researched and I enjoy the interviewer asking interesting questions.
18,18,"""IF YOU WANT THE FUTURE TO BE GOOD, YOU MUST MAKE IT SO. TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT GOOD, AND IT WILL BE"" WELL SAID ELON !!!"
19,19,"So far this has been one of the best Elon’s interviews, happy that the interviewer is knowledgeable about Musk’s endeavors and questions are somewhat interesting. It shows respect for Elon’s time."
20,20,"Watching this made me realise just how consumed I've let myself become by the ever accelerating existential dread that is continuously being leaked out into society. This untethered and unwelcome generalised anxiety that belongs to everyone and no one, undermining dreams and mutilating hope."
21,21,Mr. Musk really is a human that gives me hope for the future. I love his attitude. I hope that I will have the chance to meet and converse maybe even work with him one day
22,22,"This interview gives me hope for humanity. I for one, have a BIG interest in space technology and astronomy. One of my goals in life, is to help push humans further out into the depths of space and explore."
23,23,"Very interesting and fascinating stuff. Elon does appear to have an incredible mind.

I do wonder, what impact the manufacture of batteries would be. Is there better alternatives for the storage of energy ?"
24,24,The Tesla robot could be the caregiver we all need in our lives. Or a secondary care giver so the primary can actually sleep at night. I’ve been there and could have used a robot to help.
25,25,"Despite what the social media and news wants you to think, we can build a great future."
26,26,"Interesting... I find it mind boggling that we're trying to find an extremely complex digital solution for safely dealing with an analog world/infrastructure.  Seems like we're using technology to make a square peg fit into round hole when we should just make the old round hole a square over time.  Then again, listening to Elan... that would be the easy way out and the challenging approach pushes innovation whether we need to or not. Again, interesting.  I love this."
27,27,This is a mind blowing interview.
28,28,Enjoyable topic well thought out questions and great replies from Elon! The battery development is in great transitional stage. Bright future ahead while solving some present problems. Thank you Elon for tackling Twitter and censorship.
29,29,"Elon being his usual brilliant self. Smart and optimistic, never minding the nay-sayers. Great interview."
30,30,"Resourced based economy was first talked about by Jacques Fresco, everyone thought he was nuts. If only he was listened to, we would not be in the position we are today having to think of ways to help save the planet. This can still be done and Elon is on the right track by making products that last and can be used over and over again in space. Cars can be made to last for ever and shared with others not sitting in a car park all day (as Jacques Fresco said. Transportation and building made to last forever and economical environmentally effective. Look up The Venus Project in Florida. Roxanne is still running the project."
31,31,Props to Chris Anderson and the rest of the TED team. This is such a great interview. All questions are well curated; well researched. Execution is perfect. Held Elon accountable as necessary but at the same time gave him time to explain. TED talks with Elon will go down in history for sure.
32,32,I loved this interview very positive and uplifting.
33,33,What an amazing interview! I love this man!
34,34,far out the last 10 minutes of that interview is beyond epic. New found respect for Elon.
35,35,"This is a beautiful blending of two personalities into one strong interview. Elon is  a visionary involving the physical needs  of humanity and the Earth,  a man  who is a dreamer, a purveyor of moral obligations to his human family and a doer.  Chris, thank you for drawing him out and helping him present his true love for us."
36,36,"What a wonderful, insightful, purposeful conversation. It really puts life into perspective listening to Elon discuss the future, his view on humanity and where we could get to as a species if we work hard to do so.. It makes everything else seem so trivial and irrelevant  when you really look at the big picture we call life... Im genuinely excited and  optimistic after listening to this discussion and  truly seeing what his intentions and ambitions are for the human race!"
37,37,This was the most important video to watch this year. The pessimism and non action circulating in today's culture has kept us back from a bigger vision and enthusiasm for the future. Let's go claim a better future together.
38,38,"""If you want the future to be good, make it good. Take action""
Absolutely beautifully and simply said"
39,39,"""If you want the future to be good, you must make it so; take action to make it so, and it will be. "" 1:06:00 to the end.  I love this man for restoring my faith in humanity."
40,40,OMG reminded me of the first ted talk I watched with Elon Musk  Such an inspiration this man!!!
41,41,"Open Minded, innovative and refreshing to hear since I cant remember when."
42,42,Nice interview. Really excited for Tesla's future Should I buy before split or after split? Too hard to decide. I‘ll do both.
43,43,Excellent Interviewer and interviewee responses.  May the force be with you.
44,44,He is the literal genius ... I wish I  had the superpower to have a deep insight of what's going inside his mind . Incase if it doesn't blow my mind .
45,45,"I am 52 yrs old.  Listening to the future that Elon will accomplish, makes me sad that I will not live long enough to see the full realization of his endeavors.
At the same time, I am VERY HAPPY that I am alive to witness the accomplishments he has already achieved and will achieve in my life time."
46,46,Elon Musk gives me hope for a future that just 15 years ago I thought was bleak.
47,47,Wow. That was awesome. I’m glad I watched until the end. What a legend.
48,48,"I have MS so I will be really keeping my eye on the progress of Neural Link, it could be a life changer in so many ways.  Its far far off from being anything really useful yet for us, but the potential is massive.  It could be the one and only thing to reverse the horrible symptoms of MS and other brain related disabilities.  And until then maybe his Robots will be around to fully help us with so many things that we just can't do ourselves anymore!"
49,49,Love Elon ! He is a treasure!
50,50,Elon musk is a freaking Genius!!! Thank you god! For this man. At last a breath of fresh air and food news about the future! Hope we’re all here to see it.
51,51,The only person that makes you excited about the future!
52,52,"A core question is probably whether it makes more sense to have a very complex, general-purpose robot, or have a whole bunch of very specialized robots. The more I think about it, the generalized approach could be really powerful. But where I have serious doubts is whether there's any real for that generalized device to be in the form of a human body. Wouldn't it make much more sense for the robot to have a highly adaptable shape, in particular with a variable number and type of appendages? Hans Moravec, I think, was promoting the idea of a ""robot bush"" a few decades ago. I'm sure that idea is still being seriously pursued, and maybe has been taken a lot farther since then. Where does it stand now?"
53,53,"33:07 What I enjoy about Elon Musk is that for him solving brain injuries and spinal injuries is a ""just""

Most people that would be a goal, for him thats part of a larger issue. Its like solving cancer to cure mortality lol."
54,54,"I <am loving your work as always. Happy Easter to you and your family! I already spent some USDT on BTC, I think it has great potential. Good to be on the edge of progress! With so many traders doing these long term, out of touch, time frames it's a breathe of fresh air to have you do a down to earth daily view point. Keep it up. The way you deliver the content is so easy to understand. Did you do any courses on public speaking? Cheers. The cryptocurrency market continues to be untypically calm, with bitcoin failing to make a decisive move while still standing above $40,000. Most of the altcoin space is in a similar position, except for Filecoin, which soared by double digits. Honestly, the right information is what we need to be successful. The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine. Successful people do daily what the unsuccessful only do occasionally, I can unequivocally say that trading is one of the most profitable and lucrative business for every investors with the right expert. I believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why I made huge profits with the help of Mrs. Stacy Huth , she is a genius and that is why I always advise beginners to trade with professionals like her. So far I have been able to increase my trading portfolio from day trading with 2.07 btc to over 14 btc with the accurate trading signal given to me by a veteran trader and signal provider Mrs Stacy Huth I can attest to the accuracy of her trading strategy. You all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to her for profitable trading system on Telegram @ coin_signal10  ** for any crypto related issues "
55,55,"The way that he's humble, don't even care if he worth 300 billion something dollars, and just do the best to be beneficial for humanity is just so inspiring. We certainly need more people like him"
56,56,"love this guy!! hes a genius and works 24/7 but i would love to talk to him for one hour.  He seems genuinely concerned to solve problems for humanity.  i want to be optimistic about the future "" i dont want to blow your mind, but i'm not always right"".  give him a chance.  He's an innovator in the company of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Nicola Tesla."
57,57,"""If you want the future to be good, you must make it so.""  I love that quote."
58,58,"Very refreshing interview. Many people (myself included) probably didn't know the etymology of ""philanthropy."" Now I do... I'm always learning something from Elon."
59,59,Every Elon Musk interview gets me excited about the future and really inspires me to be a better human in my own way.
60,60,A very deep and interesting interview with Elon. I only missed a topic about the Starlink project.
61,61,Elon Musk is making me hope the future won't suck. Thank you Elon.
62,62,Hey Mr Musk.... You're such an inspiration... would it be possible if we would have you for another 50 years we all need you!
63,63,"Elon Musk: ""A future worth getting excited about""
Jordan Peterson: ""A heaven worth striving for""

Thats why they have inspired a complete generation of young people, and also one of the many reasons why I respect them."
64,64,Great interview!! I enjoyed this very much!
65,65,"One thing I like about Elon Musk is his honesty. ""I don't wanna blow your mind, but I'm not always right."" Great humility in there."
66,66,"""There is a whole generation coming through who seem really sad about the future. What would you say to them?""

""Well I think if you want the future to be good, you must make it so. Take action, to make it good, and it will be."" -Elon Musk"
67,67,"Yes, a future worth getting excited about - as long as you can afford it."
68,68,If we want the future to be good we must make it so. Enough said.
69,69,Massive respect for Elon.
70,70,"My prediction: if someone solves self-driving AI for Mumbai and Pune roads, they would automatically have an AI which can work for any road in the world."
71,71,"His message, right at the end, was simple, poignant and to-the-point ...""if you want the future to be good, make it good! Take action"""
72,72,As a co believer in Super AI I often wonder if Elon factors into his timelines the arrival of Super AI in terms of its ability to radically and rapidly solve every complex issue.
73,73,Well done Elon musk! Great job.
74,74,"First time to watch an Elon Musk’s interview. Goosebumps! We need people like him, thinking not their own benefits but for the best of humanity. Long live Elon Musk."
75,75,I fix machines and robots for a living and they definitely breakdown. Automation makes things faster and more efficient but the failures can be catastrophic.
76,76,"I honestly think that more people will wake up tomorrow feeling more excited about the future because of this one man,..how many people can you actually speak about like this and mean it?...I hope Elon is for the good of all people, I think he is."
77,77,"For a guy who's time is so valuable, he was extremely generous with it here. We need more people like him."
78,78,Elon Musk is somebody I look up to the man thinks out of the Box and I love it!
79,79,Definitely the best interview so far. The interviewer was very respectful of Elon and structured his questions in an unbiased way. Very very refreshing!!
80,80,"A $5,000 personal vehicle? The line-up will be miles long and I'll be in it! It'll be small and fairly short range at that price, but I live in town. Overall, a fantastic concept!"
81,81,"Elon is awesome....Positive attitude. One has to have a positive attitude. because problems will always be there. One just has to figure out how to overcome them. Yes, wake up and look over the horizon for a better future and make changes as need be."
82,82,"23:30 frankly i think it should be a bit of Battlestar Galactica logic applied here.
Not only some firewall or software block that prevents core functions from being overridden / updated via the internet, but to actually have those components TOTALLY isolated, physically, from any network connection. Like, dont even connect those routines with any network chip what so ever, make it impossible, even if the ""wifi-connected-CPU"" gets hacked."
83,83,"I love this Guy, I wish all the powerful people think like that, find a better solutions to solve our problem instead of a short cut solution like depopulation and so on."
84,84,"“Well, I think if you want the future to be good, you must make it so.

Take action to make it good.
And it will be.”"
85,85,What an amazing interview! Wow! Thank you.
86,86,That was amazing Musk is a gift to mankind and Mr Ted has an uncanny ability to do his thing and bring out the best in Elon or anyone which is his gift
87,87,"I can relate so much to Elon, in the way he responds to people, and how much he cares about truth,  a good future for mankind and how isolated one can feel from Asperger’s syndrome. I tested high in the Asperger’s scoring but I missed out the genius aspect of the syndrome."
88,88,The Market has been pretty bad until today it decided to surge. Everybody was Practically Crying then. It kept dipping. That's what you get when you feel you can navigate the process on your own. Big thank to Hilder Ferguson. I'm not bothered with how bad the Market is because my assests are insured due to her advice and I still receive my profits
89,89,We are the “little candle of consciousness in the vast darkness of space” Elon Musk (this generation’s Thomas Edison reaching out towards Einstein’s cosmic landscape).
90,90,I haven't watched the whole interview yet. I love Elon Musk's ideas. It's a brilliant future. But I can't help but wonder where does the hourly worker fit into this. How do unskilled/uneducated people survive?
91,91,"It is the best interview I have seen from Elon, it leaves a great feeling. Elon is a great visionary with an inspiring and authentic cause. Thanks TED for this!"
92,92,"Dear Mr. musk, it’s so refreshing to listen to someone, who actually know what they’re talking about, and has a plan, could you make this country great again. I hope you run for president,"
93,93,Love this man. So inspirational to younger folks. Especially in a world that's dominated by nihilists and those intent on destroying progress.
94,94,sometimes you really need to reinvent the wheel. The integration of AI vehicles within our preexisting infrastructure not only limits the potential tech capabilities but it is taking up valuable time/creativity/innovation that could be better spent coming up with something that isn't even imaginable right now. He sort of tried to do that with his concept of the drill tunnels but that is proving to be even more difficult than the concept of integration. I say make battery operated hover vehicles that are controlled by your thousands of satellites you already have up in space. you can do it Elon...2040 lets do it!
95,95,What a fascinating interview!
96,96,"20:00 people dont even comprehend how huge Optimus will be.
It's a world changer just like the PC."
97,97,"Great and inspiring interview with an interviewer that goes beyond asking the obvious questions. Showing these things to my kids to inspire them,
‘If you want a good future, go out and make it so.’ A very simple but very powerful and actionable message.
Thanks Elon for providing hope and inspiration to humanity!"
98,98,"We all love you Elon! Thank you for bringing the jobs and money to my home state of Texas!!
Good luck with that Twitter crap ️"
99,99,Mind-blowing interview. Always interesting to listen to Elon
100,100,So envious I would love to have five minutes to talk with Elon Musk. Inspirational interview people should take it to heart. The future is bright.
101,101,Elon has a beautiful mind thank you for making the future of my grandchildren better and exciting
102,102,I am officially looking for a brighter future. THANK YOU ELON!!
103,103,"In most interviews, the interviewer tries to show off.  Chris Anderson is such a great host. He asks important questions, but also puts the interviewee at ease."
104,104,I am 73 years old and quite poor but I believe this visionary man is a gift to humanity. Thank you Mr Musk for being alive. I hope you will live long to see the fruits of your vision. The world needs you.
105,105,"""If you want the future to be good, you must make it so."" - Elon Musk"
106,106,Thank you for your things you do for mankind. 
107,107,You are so unselfish ! Thank you for your time Elon Musk. Thank you for your work and vision .
108,108,Two BIG heroes are very old now. My heart hurts. Let's use their legacy as a stepping stone to lead the next generation. I LOVE YOU GUYS  !!
109,109,"the robots I think will be a mistake, there will be a very low demand for it. Elon is a genius, but you can't always be right"
110,110,"""if you want the future to be good make it so""
Elon musk."
111,111,"I love his closing line, ""Take action to make it good, and then it will be."" 
So many people get this wrong. We're in a generation full of people who complain about everything as if it's beyond them, rather than forging themselves into the solution to the problems that keep them up at night. I wish more people followed this advice. Be the change you want to see in the world. It's so simple. Stop whining and get to work."
112,112,love his visions! Great watch!
113,113,"35:55 and this is what I'm here for, Elon can break things down and show a new perspective that will help understand what's really happening or going to happen in the world"
114,114,"Elon Musk ""We need to be careful of automation destroying our society""
Also Elon Musk Creates the most advance robot ever"
115,115,"1:03:38 'I mean, at this point it's water off a duck's back.' Great way to put it. 
Real life Tony Stark, current greatest innovative inventor. Down to earth genius, billionaire, philanthropist . . . Respectable . . ."
116,116,I'm so happy and excited! Thank you so much Elon.
117,117,"I actually think the interviewer was trying hard not to spill out all his dreams he pondered in the late nights of his life.  It was rather incredible and added a dimension to the interview that I enjoyed very deeply. That deep big dream for the future is missing in near every sphere of human endeavor today . 
War , supply chain issues , global crisis,  and on and on.  It's so inspiring to see a host let out their deeper self ."
118,118,"Elon's curiosity and drive are a blessing for our civilisation. He is like Leonardo born nowadays, and I am firmly convinced that a lot of the innovations entailed to reach some of his objectives will turn out as products and utilities per se in the future (as the ink pen invented by Leonardo to write his documents). And just to say, after the next 5 billion years our planet will be burnt anyway by the Sun, at the end of its life, and expanding as a giant red. So we shall be prepared, if still existing, to find another good place to leave on."
119,119,What a great interview! Thanks for picking someone who “gets” Elon and actually asks some great questions and gets Elon to open up. Thanks
120,120,I think we all should be thankful for what Elon Musk is trying to do for humanity.
121,121,Protect this man at all cost!
122,122,"Towards the end Chris brought the topic of some people not being okay with a single person amassing such huge wealth. Well the thing that we need to focus on is how the person we are pointing fingers at amassed such huge amounts of wealth. If it's by fair means, then what is the problem? Elon has not looted from people to fill his pockets. He has worked hard day in and day out to build products that make our lives easier. He is a visionary."
123,123,I feel he truly isn't in it for the money. Money just helps him help all of us. Thanks Elon
124,124,"I prefer this Elon to the meme version on Twitter. 

Very composed, great answers, and the interviewer did a great job as well"
125,125,One of the best interviews I have ever watched. Kudos to all involved!
126,126,Great interview! The interviewer was fantastic as well
127,127,"He makes me a little nervous by how much he is conflicted,but the fact that he is conflicted also makes me ok with what he is getting doing.People that can look you in the eye and sound so confident  are capable, and zre most likely lieing to us."
128,128,"It will happen. 
I love high quality thinking, like absolute problem solving ;)
This man is opensourcing the future. many don’t even understand. try."
129,129,"""Elon Musk is optimistic about the world's future because he's part of the solution, not the problem....I hope he treats all of his employees as possible inventors and not inventory."""
130,130,"Elon,  your the man! You inspire me."
131,131,Great interview
132,132,"Wow! Kudos to the moderator on this interview. Questions, responses, pace on the conversation, and balance… beautiful sir. Thank you Elon for your hard work."
133,133,"It will be interesting to see how they solve the low gravity on Mars and its effects on the human body long-term. Not to mention the solar radiation due to the weak magnetic field. Also is the sun too far for us to make vitamin D on Mars? Maybe genetic modification, going underground, or finding the cure for cancer. The people of Mars would be more motivated to solve those problems and would hopefully share their findings with the people of earth."
134,134,"Great information and knowledge. <Starting early is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority. I stopped panicking about my BTC the very moment I started working with Kennet Gibbs last year, his confidence and skills is on a maximum level…"
135,135,"elon and his team are curing my existential dread from the life i chose, i've asked my GF to remind me of SpaceX and Starlink when ever it gets to much, which is pretty much all the time now, as i'm an austrAlien from austraLiar having a hellection. 
i can't wait to see if it's even possible to witness a SpaceX Starship with my own eyes from the west australien desert (PILBARA), maybe even on a full moon, who knows it might even restart my souls, or it could give me the best send off, gift me an ever lasting smile from conscience. good luck masters of the universe, sorry i let mine fade away, i just wasn't meant to shine, glad you all do though, it still gifts me that smile."
136,136,"One single man, changing the whole world!"
137,137,Can we just give incredible kudos to this interviewer? Such an awesome interview!
138,138,"Only five or six people in the history of mankind helped humanity move forward in the right direction. In a thousand years, other human will look back and realize how this moment was a defining moment in history."
139,139,"What an absolutely AMAZING interview. Chris did an amazing job, asking some super interesting questions. I loved it."
140,140,"The interviewer is quite briliant, Musk is a Genius."
141,141,"Elon will never seize to amaze me
He has the passion, motivation and vision of a child but the experience, capability and knowledge of an intelligent adult and you can clearly see it in the way he talks about the stuff he does"
142,142,amazing interview Elon is my hero fr tho so smart and thought out
143,143,I am always impressed. Elon comes across as genuine and speaking the truth. He seems knowledgeable about Earth's biggest challenges. I think Elon has a proven track record and inspires humanity.
144,144,"He is someone who has built a career in business but still remains philosophical and mindful of the future of our civilization. It is very remarkable to see because it is so uncommon, especially among billionaires."
145,145,"""I'm more motivated by curiosity than anything"" ~Elon"
146,146,"I would love to know what Elon Musk thinks about super-deep, critical geo-thermal"
147,147,"To put in perspective Musk's relevance, consider this quick (and certainly incomplete) list: da Vinci, Copernicus, Galilei, Newton, Maxwell, Wright Bros., H. Ford, Einstein, Bohr, Turing, von Neumann, Goddard, von Braun. And now Elon Musk's name can surely be added to this list. Pretty relevant to the human endeavor, this guy."
148,148,Excellent interview thank you.
149,149,Good true thoughts. I agree with Elon's pro-nuclear stance.
150,150,"I'm glad he's cleared up the self driving topic.
Intelligent systems are one thing. Decision support and the like...!
AI is not so easily quantified or designed, because we don't understand it, in the first place."
151,151,"Wow, this interview was amazing! Chris asking so many interesting and pointed questions, it felt like 15 minutes watching all of this."
152,152,"Self driving must be so difficult because when we have self driving vehicles we basically have the beginnings of a fully fledged hunanoid Android, take away the wheels and add legs and arms to one of these vehicles and add the ai version of a humanoid brain and we have an real ai in a humanoid or similar form. It’s not just self driving as such it covers the whole spectrum of artificial intelligence replicating motion as do all forms of life"
153,153,"What an interesting guy! I look forward to see him and his companies evolve and shape human civilization.

Electric vehicles will go a long way to mitigate some anthropogenic GHGs. The other key solutions to reach net zero are: efficiency, low-carbon electricity, electrification, alternative fuels (such as hydrogen and bioenergy), and behavioural changes. Only if those 6 are combined will we have a fighting chance of reaching net zero."
154,154,"""Energy wise it will be good"", but I do wonder about how ourselves we'll be when we get there..."
155,155,"Elon has many times publicly expressed a high level of caution about Artificial Intelligence. That magic moment when it becomes self aware and in real time creates safeties that prevent itself from being shut down. (Internet-wide distribution would be it's means for that. And that is very well illustrated in the movie Transcendence) So, for Elon to be so aggressively pursuing AI, even if he claims it's just to bring his self driving vehicles to fruition - doesn't completely make sense. Either AI is dangerous or it's not. I personally do not want my vehicle to attain self awareness - ever. I don't see that as a plus."
156,156,Excellent interview. One question is missing. Why did you choose the long term path to populate Mars when the moon is ii our back yard?
157,157,Inspiration Interview as always! Love every single moment when Elon talks.
158,158,21:48... this is where you ask him to elaborate! Don't change the subject. Oh my God. I wish I was Elon Musk personal assistant or something close to that. The guy is just dishing out golden info.
159,159,"I think the most profound things he said in this interview[49:06] was the move away from representational democracy to a direct democracy, having laws that are short enough for people to understand, and making it harder to make laws than to get rid of laws.  Excellent interview!"
160,160,It's amazing that Elon's IQ is only 105 and he had done so much.
161,161,"For most, words ignite imagination. For him, words are tools to create wealth. I recommend to everyone to remember that"
162,162,"this is the best thing on TED in like 5+ years, maybe 10+."
163,163,"glad elon is the wealthiest human, he is setting great examples with his success  for others to follow. very inspirational. Thank you"
164,164,I'm glad you addressed the fact that Elon claims plenty and delivers far less. He has a habit of being dishonest to hype up investors then doesn't deliver his promises. He said there would be a million self driving taxis in 2020 conveniently he didn't need to make that happen and instead spent the investment money on producing fairly standard passenger vehicles
165,165,"Thank you for making this available on YouTube, TED."
166,166,Personally I think we can greatly reduce the need for battery technology by changing the fundamental way in which we live .... Still important but if we work with when the sun is up and wind is blowing there won't be the need for storing great volumes of energy to pump back into the grid.
167,167,Always Interesting Concepts Elon. Great explanations and word pictures. Mark Fogerty
168,168,"Getting rid of PC and woke ""culture"" would be probably the biggest achievement and favor for mankind to continue develop. You know what to do, Elon, sir."
169,169,This guy is an expert level interviewer.
170,170,The most important person of  this century and beyond!! Take note science professors … make science exciting again!
171,171,"Excellent interview, executed flawlessly. One for the archives. Thank you!"
172,172,Elon's prediction of an age of abundance sounds highly plausible when you consider nature's cyclical inclanation. Like the fall that follows a peak and the flood that follows a drought.
173,173,"24:36
The reason Elon is MVP of this world"
174,174,Musk has a knack always getting to the first principles!
175,175,"I'm big into harnessing the power of the tides and waves which never stop and always are in motion. I see this as being a huge player in sustainable energy, we just need to figure out how to collect it minus all the corrosive negatives due to the salt water."
176,176,Elon gives me mega chills. i love the way he carries himself; his knowledge even if he doesn't get to or want to express all he knows; his drivability in bettering this world - it's absolutely gorgeous. he's the best boss i've ever had the honor to work for.
177,177,Elon trying and succeeding in attempts to bring the future into the present day… Elon’s last quote in this interview brought me a tear and hope at the same time.
178,178,I love him like I know many others do too.
179,179,"I have a complex relationship with Elon Musk. 

Generally I don’t trust people with too much power, but I feel some hope with this guy having the power that he does."
180,180,"""Almost anyone can save up $100K"" (45:45)
""The birth rate on Earth is so low that we're facing civilizational collapse"" (1:03:50)
These quotes are important too when evaluating Musk's vision. Optimism is easier if you ignore the reality most people live in. The end quote is equally valid though."
181,181,"54:00 i mean the minimum travel time will never go below 2 hours though.
Because you have to get from your apartment / hotel / office to the launchpad outside the city.
Then check in, wait for the next launch. Then be on the actual flight.
Then go from the destination landing pad to the city."
182,182,"I’m 62 and retired with $57,000 left on my mortgage and $600,000 saved in my portfolio for retirement — should I pay off my home now?"
183,183,"In case anybody cares, the way geopolitics revolves around the money flow... And Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink, etc... Is going to put this man and his vision at the pinnacle of global power by an order of magnitude and possibly larger than the GDP of America by the end of the decade. He is the GOAT and the OG and the BOSS. It's a god's blessing..."
184,184,"I thought I missed out for not knowing about bucky fuller until after his death, but musk has that same level of optimism and does the same to ease my fears about the future. We are bombarded with so much negativity I can't help but become a pessimist. I need to listen to musk speak more often."
185,185,Fantastic interview. I'm definitely exited about the future. And what a great job interviewing Musk that Anderson did.
186,186,"love or hate? agree or disagree? you have to give the man credit, he is doing what many, many others who have come before him, who have talked the talk (without actually walking the walk), who've earned vast amounts of money yet were never able to do right by humanity, he says it how it is and i think he genuinely wants to better the future of humanity, he has goals and unlike many people of vast wealth of the past, he is willing to risk it all in order to improve and push the boundaries, he's made fortunes only to put it all on the line on the next venture, i give him props for that, i just wish we had more people walking the planet like him, instead of the usual money hungry people who say they are trying to help, saying they're working for the betterment of humanity, but in reality they don't give a toss, they care for themselves and their family's lives, the world we are told we live in is vastly different that the low paid poverty stricken reality where half the planet starves as the other half is either burning from heatwaves or drowning in floods, it needs to change, we need to fix it and we need the help of people like musk because the government's we have don't represent the people in the correct way, they don't listen or understand the people (or don't care if they do?) the clean healthy planet friendly future is possible, it's available if we only just put the effort in and pull away from the oil and gas path of destruction, yet i fear if left up to the government's of today, it'll never happen? they never seem to be able to get on, keep pushing agenda's trying to make us all believe thet this people or that people all hate us or are jealous of us etc, who cares? i don't care about any other country or it's people, so long as they are not trying to hurt us or push their agenda's on us then who cares, most normal everyday people from anywhere in the world are just trying to live day by day and look after their family's, not many give a second thought what mr and mrs brown from pine road in whatever country are up to? let alone angry because they have green grass and a new car, we need tl be better than the people who are ment to run our country's."
187,187,“Your future is whatever you make it. So make it a good one” Doc Musk
188,188,"""Whose city is it? Is it NASA's city is it SpaceX's city""
""It's the people of Mars' city.""
** Stunned **"
189,189,Inspiring interview.
190,190,"just one more step, Elon, just make a fully electric rocket, then even aliens might suprised"
191,191,One of the best if not the best Elon interview to date. You really pulled out Elon’s visions of the future in a vivid way. Well done!
192,192,I just wanna say: Thank you Elon!
193,193,"This was my first time hearing Elon Musk ever. Oh boy, ""He has literally hijacked my mind"". I still can't digest all these future images that seems like a fantasy. And he is genuinely a good human being just like he is a sublime businessman."
194,194,This interview has immediately inspired me to lease a new Tesla and take out a Starlink subscription 
195,195,There are so many good quotes in here Elon is a poet
196,196,"With 8k comments already, I am leaving one more for the algorithm. Thanks for interviewing Musk. I hope he continues to inside and change the world."
197,197,I think this is the best interview with Elon we have on record.  Thanks Chris - you nailed it for TED.
198,198,This is one of the finest interviews of Elon I've ever watched.
199,199,I gota say... He's talks so simply. He logically guides you through his reasoning... Other CEOs usually just say generic bullet points about their products. He's explains his fundamental logic.
200,200,"i'm excited about 'our' future, as i am 'mine'. Hopefully humans can lower their resistance to change and be open to new tech and ways of living. And experiencing 'living' rather than 'existing'...."
201,201,I would really like to see Elon taking about sustainable boats to clean up the ocean and a effort to clean up the space trash we created so far.
202,202,"Sir in my life my main goal is meeting you  
  You are my inspiration
 When I was in a depression I will watch your biography on YouTube , 
Whereas I will fell incentive. "
203,203,34:13 He is crying. This man is legit a human genius but still a human. I love him!
204,204,Elon is like a doctor for the world. The world is a little sick and he’s just patching it up
205,205,I think this was an incredible interview. So much value for 1 hour. Intellectually dense and yet easy to consume.
206,206,His predictions are just like me predicting when I will finish my thesis
207,207,"To me Elon is one of the great heroes of these times, and ultimately, of all times. By now, technology is our Obi-Wan Kenobi."
208,208,"An amazing conversation . . . I would love to see a three way conversation between Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, and Bishop Robert Barron . . . wherein they each come to the table with a question and they discuss all three . . .  YouTube would explode"
209,209,This is the most talkative interview I’ve ever seen he almost talks more than Ellen
210,210,"great video, great interview, Elon is DA MAN"
211,211,We need to literally protect Elon at any and all cost
212,212,We need more people like Elon Musk. He is an amazing human who is helping the world and humanity.
213,213,"Sharing Nate Latka sentiments - 
Elon Musk here sounds like the mega Customer Service of the 3Ps - professionalism, people- first attitude and patience, (tons of patience listening to Chris questions & enquiries then taking time to express point by point)."
214,214,"I hope Elon's right. We do make our own happiness one daily basis. Elon  is only human though- (I think lol), and maybe the smartest guy on earth, but still human. I think the future of the entire world is largely in the hands of something greater than us humans. I mean there could be a nuclear war within a few months, or we might hit a huge milestone- like a full cure for cancer, or something that extends an average lifespan by 50 years within a few years. It's better for the mental state to think positively anyways. I stopped listening to the news completely, and swear it pretty much cured my depression. I think more people should try it"
215,215,"A very informative, interesting and clear interview.  My thanks to both, Chris Anderson and Elon Musk for sitting down and responding to some
of our main questions.  Elon, you are such a fine thinking man and I, now, feel like our future is not so bleak.  Thank you.  I only wish there were millions of men who think the way you do!  We are behind you."
216,216,I think this guy has already found a way to somehow live forever.
217,217,"This was one of the best interview of Elon, even he was so interested in questions and talking about the future, telling people to think about the possibilities we can make with a good mindset."
218,218,Chris Anderson is a great interviewer
219,219,"You can totally imagine seeing this video in a museum in 30 years and people will struggle to remember what life was like before we had cheap and unlimited energy, robot helpers, self-driving cars and rockets that take us anywhere in the planet in 30 minutes."
220,220,Look how tired he looks. He's truly pushing himself beyond the limits of human potential. I hope he's okay. He's our most important human being.
221,221,"""The people of Mars"" what a phrase! Reminds me of Baba Vanga's prediction that the colony on Mars would declare independence from earth in 2170. Sounded ridiculous back then."
222,222,Excellent interview.
223,223,"Awesome interview, congrats!"
224,224,We Love & RESPECT YOU ELON!!! You are like the Tiger Woods of business!!!
225,225,Absolutely incredible interview! So much respect for Elon and all that he has done and is doing!
226,226,"AI robotics is perfect to do the space traveling for us, we can utilize the planets of our solar system which are masses of minerals, as long as there isn’t actually life on these planets they basically are giant collections of various resources, we use spaceX tech to get to these planets with AI robots to mine and transport things we need back and forth and we can build our tech on other planets rather then here on earth so we don’t hurt the earth keeping earth a biological safe biosphere, since most of our planets are vacant by what we can tell, they are ideal to do the dangerous work needed for more space travel and for making safe our species and all life and consciousness. "
227,227,"I am in no way any kind of expert in the A.I driving science. But In my lamen opinion, public highways need more uniformity. The biggest uniform thing in my mind is consistent and clear road markings , which may include some form of readable pattern for the computer for intersections, speed limits, school and emergency site locations. Another would be standardized vehicle lights and signals. And when thinking REAL big, i feel we need to seperate logisitical travel from civil and commuter travel. Get back to using rail more and or use a.i land trains with specific and isolated ""lanes"""
228,228,Dam. This Elon guy is a fkn genious. Besides the fact that he wants everyone to go green in the future. He may not know that some live for being covered in old motoroil and listening to the roar of the motors turning on.
229,229,The very end of that interview—wow. The best part in my humble opinion. ️
230,230,he is so ahead in his thoughts and ideas.
231,231,"""If you want the future to be good you must make it so, take action to make it so and it will be"" perfect way to end an excellent interview"
232,232,"I'm convinced Elon Musk is a James Bond villian.

Just look a him, he's perfect for that role."
233,233,seems very comfortable giving such strong statements as to how things will play out.
234,234,"AI development will create the possibility of the general purpose humanoid robot. This will likely create the societal condition of plenty rather than scarcity. In the spectrum of human capability, there are vast differences in potential contribution to society by individuals. If general purpose humanoid robots can do everything that the “less capable” segment of humanity can contribute, what is the alternative? Will the product of robots in service or manufacturing be somehow available to individuals? Will those with the capacity to innovate in a way that humanoid robots cannot be compensated in a different way? Will some people elect a life of leisure while others work? In a free, market-based society, value is added whenever labor and materials are combined to create a new product or service. If a large proportion of the population is no longer required to participate directly to achieve this level of plenty, how DO they participate? I guess we need some more sci-fi authors to ponder…"
235,235,"I had put this interview on in the background while playing a video game (skywalker saga for anyone curious), and just as the interview was wrapping up the last question asked made me stop playing for a moment and pay attention to the video. I have a notebook I like to keep interesting thoughts I have or quotes I read, and that question and response between Chris Anderson and Elon Musk will be going in that notebook."
236,236,He has created a genius cluster.
237,237,"Great to see how humble Elon can be, best interview of 2022, best interviewer for 2022 so far... Huge  to them both"
238,238,"""Comforts that were rare among our forefathers are now multiplied in factories and handed out wholesale; and indeed, nobody nowadays, so long as he is content to go without air, space, quiet, decency and good manners, need be without anything whatever that he wants; or at least a reasonably cheap imitation of it."" -G.K. Chesterton"
239,239,"I like the sustainable energy future. Thing is, on a program I watched by some expert, some of the materials used in making these batteries, has to be done by massive strip mining of the planet. Not by drilling..or going underground, but  stripping the surface of parts of the planet. Mountains, hills, forestry etc. This way of mining could poison rivers and lakes. I mention this because as a child, I am now 72, I watched as our local countryside was devastated by strip mining for coal. Afterwards, when mining was finished and the massive creator was filled in, what was left behind was ugly. No rolling hills or grassland as it once was, but a gray, flat, ugliness. Those that came after me, would have thought it was always so...but it wasn't. We used to pick-nick, and have adventures amongst its previous beauty. All kinds of birds, insects, including beautiful dragon flies, frogs, newts, rabbits and hare's. Why is it that to give humans a cleaner future, we first have to destroy nature. Destroy natural beauty? I know things have to change to make way for cleaner energy,.but do we have to destroy nature's natural beauty along the way ? Will what we end up with, be worth it in the end ? Ugly wind turbines spoiling the horizon, and the terrible scars of strip mining ? Not to mention the effects it all has on wildlife. I am glad I am old..I won't be around to see it..I mean that. Maybe I am unknowingly exaggerating it..I truly hope so."
240,240,"15:44 Elon is trying to create short-term memory a.i. brains, basically in a layman’s look at it"
241,241,我喜欢马斯克的分享精神，这可以从他的商业模式中学到很多东西，我和我的团队专门研究了一下，也许很多人无法理解，但只有深入的分析和研究才能真正知道，可以向自己学习，这样他们就可以学到一些概念和思维方式。
242,242,For self driving to work in India you need real world AI and a desire to be on the edge of life 
243,243,America...welcome Elon Musk the King of our future and a genuine good man. Awesome interview! Just great!
244,244,A living example of someone who thinks leagues faster than he speaks lol his words are running into each other. Great to pick his brain!
245,245,"As mankind, unlimited inspiration and imagination are the profound ingredients that makes us move forward with optimism.
Elon is a great example of such a mankind. Respect!"
246,246,"We need to make EV, solar, and wind turbines more affordable if we are going to make the switch. Not to mention the cost of the batteries to store the electricity.."
247,247,"1:06:06  Right. Accept what is, let go of what was, and have faith in what will be. And see it as it is, not worse than it is, see it better than it is, and make it the way you see it."
248,248,"I just watched this 1 hour video and learnt more about a lot of things that I ever learnt in an hour. I have more appreciation, respect and optimism about Elon that ever before."
249,249,"Your are INCREDIBLE. The highest portfolio of public evidence to show competence and good management.  
It's sad that South Africa lost you! 
You are phenomenal!"
250,250,Musk is cool. I wish we have like 6 or 7 of them.
251,251,"This was one of the best interviews I have watched. Thank you Elon for all that you are doing. Love when it gets brought about about the left side and right side and how you can argue with a billionaire who doesn’t own a home trying to solve our worlds problems. I understand the stance of no one deserves to have that much money, but he’s not consuming like the rest of these billionaires out there."
252,252,"A great and spectacular interview (and thank you Chris) with the humble Musk. Nuff said and ""Make it so""."
253,253,"Many thanks to all the people who buy Tesla cars, thanks also to the investors! You help change the world!"
254,254,Imagine you could watch Da Vinci or Newton while they were alive. I believe we witnessing just that when we watch Elon
255,255,"I love you, Elon, brother.  1:04:12 We have the same great goals."
256,256,"If you want the future to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good, and it will be."
257,257,"Loved this Interview. Elon's vision is so inspring. I want to have a future talk on how all the incentives : Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink,& Boring Company converge and synergize"
258,258,"When Elon explains things it's like a magician revealing his tricks - once you know, it's obvious."
259,259,"For all the people that dislike, or even hate him for minor reasons, it really says a lot more about them, than it does him. All things considered, an exceptional human being."
260,260,"I am satisfied  that elon is making headway, so I am good with what he is doing and what he is saying."
261,261,God bless this man.
262,262,"Look at this dude, he started a EV company who pollutes due to mining and he tells the world don't worry about Earth's future."
263,263,Really enjoyed this. Thank you
264,264,While the future may have some incredible things in store for humanity. I'm not sure if we want someone like Elon Musk to be on the forefront of this.
265,265,"I feel more intelligent after watching this ! Very skillful interviewer, and as for Elon, I'm not sure how he keeps all those plates spinning ; for me he is the most interesting person alive. Man of the century !"
266,266,i wish we got to hear more about Neuralink when Elon was going on to describe further about it - the interviewer cut him off a few times
267,267,A super man with a dream to change the world.
268,268,"22:30 pretty much all modern more expensive Robot vacume cleaners know where objects are sine they map a room. But they don't know what the objects are, at least not right now. Adding qr codes to objects might be a way to let a robot know what it is and how to use it."
269,269,"I'm actually very excited about the floods and fires to come. Perhaps a second pandemic as well. The future is full of promises, are you as excited as I am"
270,270,The future of humanity was summed up in the last 30sec of the interview.
271,271,He's literally carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.. I have noting but respect for him.
272,272,I wish Elon had a huge country where he could build a city from scratch.
273,273,i really respect this guy.
274,274,"""If you want the future to be good you must make it so, Take action! and it will be"" - Elon Musk"
275,275,I rarely comment anymore but dang this guy gives me actual hope for the future. The interviewer asking questions to Elon really knocked it out of the park!
276,276,Elon's plans for solving AI coincide with my plans for getting rich; next year! Always next year! =(
277,277,Amazing interview - thank you so much for everyone who worked to make it happen! And obviously thank you to Elon Musk for being a visionary leader that at least I (35 y) have not seen in my life time before! Let’s create an amazing future together!
278,278,A man of vision. Elon Musk.
279,279,"Great interview,well done.Really enjoyed it.Elon always makes me feel positive about the future."
280,280,"I've always thought it's strange how someone has an ""idol"". That word is too extreme for me to ever use unironically.
Elon Musk is still not my idol, but he sure seems like a sort of an ideal.
I love him. There should be statuest dedicated to him. Not in a manner of worshipping him, nothing crazy, just like, to honor him. The statue should be dressed in a funny suit so that when he walks next to it he giggles."
281,281,"The problem with self-driving cars is that the world is full of unique minds with varying moral/emotional/congnitive capacities. The car driven by a computer is going to do well, but it can’t easily predict the mistakes or odd habits of human drivers."
282,282,I love Elon! We can build a better future!
283,283,"Self-driving stumbled on the mathematical dichotomy between digital fractional computing versus the old analog instantaneous sensory technologies. We went totally digital in the 1970's with the alpha chip and never looked back until now. We essentially abandoned analog circuitry. We were so analog committed prior to that time that Apollo 11, the first Moon landing, was accomplished using almost all analog.circuitry with the exception of switching diodes. Transistors were commercially in their infancy, and ICs hadn't been invented yet."
284,284,I have the Tesla powerwall 2 and Starlink and I live in the middle of The Payette National Forest in Idaho and let me tell you it is so much better the quality of life is far and away so much easier to cope with all the craziness of what's going on in the world. So for me and my wife we are so happy he made this dream come true today not tomorrow. Go Elon gives us more I love it. And we were the 1st completely off-grid owners of the Powerwall in Idaho. It's just so much better can't figure out why there aren't more folks doing it.
285,285,I truly believe what Elon is doing is going to shape the future of humanity for the better. We are so lucky to be alive and witness all that he and his teams of amazing people are achieving. He gives me hope for the future . Go Elon!!
286,286,I love you Elon stay strong.
287,287,"I wonder if future generations will be happier in such word with robots and automation. I personally enjoy driving my car manually, working and creating to make a living, the process of making myself a cup of tea. The level of technology that abuse us is already crazy enough. We are bored without a smartphone or latest Netflix series. I don't say this to hate anything said here, just sharing my contradictory thoughts about this. I am also curious to see what future brings us and what people are capable of doing. At the same time I already feel how crippling the technology is to us, how it disables us to enjoy life as it is - beautiful, unpauseable and unexplainable experience of nature. What will we do when there is nothing else to do for us anymore because of all tech automation and AI? Will we finally go back to experiencing the very nature of our lives?"
288,288,"12:00 i know this is a super ""boring"" answer, but couldnt you achieve ""full"" self-driving much faster by installing electronic markers in the roads, that the cars can use as guidelines? Though i suppose that cost globally would be insane.
But surely not as insane as replacing every single car on the planet with a new model?"
289,289,"What road material is easier to be seen by radioactive number? Asphalt, concrete, etc.? Is it effected by tar repair? I imagine that would be difficult for AI."
290,290,"Future prospect for Tesla, I love Elon always as a man, humanitarian and caring about the future of human beings survival, thriving more than anything else. Thanks Sir Musk."
291,291,This was a great interview. I am just fascinated by all he has achieved so far and continue to set aggressive goals to achieve even more. All of his companies are focused in solving pressing issues humanity faces today both in the short term and long term. I am glad to be alive in that timeline and get to see so many of his goals being accomplished. He inspires me to do something useful for humanity. Chris Anderson asked really great questions and I like how he takes his time to briefly explain the reasoning behind each question before asking him a question. It certainly helps audience jog their memory about a certain topic or subject being asked in question. 
292,292,"Even if you are a destitute , you can gain a lot just listening to this guy."
293,293,"The big question to ask Elon is will SpaceX be the primary booster for everyone to get to orbit.  Thousand of reusable boosters sitting around waiting for the 2 year window to get to Mars. It can be launching every thing to space for ULA, Blue Origin and ESA and anyone else. The most expensive part of every space launch can be solved with SpaceX boosters.  For example the Falcon 9 upper stage represent about about 20% of it's hardware cost. If booster service is done by Starliner and that cost of launch is under $1 million then in theory a Falcon 9 upper stage launch can be done for under $15 million.  Assuming everyone else is not as efficient a Falcon 9 it would at least meant all launches done with Starliner boost can be 1/3 the cost if they use Starliner for boosting services."
294,294,"""Success isn't guaranteed. But excitement is."" When did he say that?"
295,295,"You will have to install devices into the roadway systems that the car communicates with and matches maps, signs, lights and road construction between the road and the car.  Then, you have to count every object as something you can't hit, while communicating with other smart cars on the road what evasive maneuvers are being taken.  You have to only allow the smart cars on the smart roads.  The car gives control back to the human on non-smart roads.  Also, gas (acceleration) and brakes can be enhanced by smart systems on all roads when the human retains the steering wheel with just the info on map software."
296,296,Take action to make the future good - make it so.
297,297,"Fantastic interview. I'm so glad Elon exists, it's amazing what one great human can do against all the terrible ones in power."
298,298,A guy that really cares about humanity
299,299,"Chris is such an amazing interviewer. Good questions and I just love his voice, tone and respectful way of speaking."
300,300,Best interview ever
301,301,Love this man.tThe future is going to be golden.
302,302,"Interview timeline



*The future 00:30

*Avoiding climate catastrophy 01:20"
303,303,"This rich guy is really likable.  Wish we had an army of them working together right now.  If the world develops by men like him we'll likely be really good.  If it's men like Gates, Clinton(s), and Bush(s), we'll likely be goners."
304,304,Future's gonne be AWESOME for those who can afford to pay the prize :)
305,305,"This is one of the better interviews I have ever heard, the interviewer had educated, thought provoking questions, that weren’t trying to provoke a response, but rather intellectually stimulating content.  I wish all interviews were approached similarly."
306,306,"Sometimes I think Elon is realy Al-Eon an Angel of new Eon , sent to Earth to give it a chance to survive. 
He is defenetly an elder that have great intuition and sence of fairness. His both educations as material engeneer and economist allow him to understand how to create new things and how to get financing and profit while at the same time do good for humanity in general."
307,307,Mr. EM is very smart leading and steering the conversation to sell his products. In 2050 we can tele(trans)port and all the cars can go to the scrapyard.I'm very positive aboout this.
308,308,The future´s gonna be good!
309,309,"Predictions - mindset is very cool. I never thought of it until now. It makes my thinking more focused. Especially predictions in numbers. What is the likelihood that I will finish my master's thesis? Let's say it's 80 % (assuming based on a guessed dropout rate of 20%). The luck is still on my side. Let's say I would drop my other goals and be able to  focus on the thesis, what is the likelihood that I will do it in 6 months? I would say maybe 85% - you know some life events could still happen. What about in 8 months + with the help of supervisors? I would say 95% because I could argue that most people with good supervisor relationship end up being very engaged in the process. Even though this is guess work, it's kind of motivating! I can now go around saying that it's most likely that at least in 8 months I will have done a sccesfully finished master's thesis! I mean, it's not that special. But on the other hand, if I let myself slip, I end up being one of the 20% who don't get their master's thesis done even in 2 or 3 years who end up dropping out. If I go the other route of increasing my distractions and negative emotions and staying away from the supporting superwisors because of embarrassment or fear of showing how badly I'm doing."
310,310,“ I think there should be a regulatory agency for AI.”    Oh Thanks Elon for bringing Skynet to life. We are all doomed.
311,311,"5:00 love it that he doesn't insist on being correct but invites others to the conversation. 
Go Elon"
312,312,"Listen to every word, ""just when you think you've got it solved you hit a ceiling"" yeah! The firmament!"
313,313,I think Elon Musk is the most important person alive today.
314,314,Elon Musk is awesome
315,315,"Elon tired to explain a feedback loop to the issues of labeling and auto software labeling with human editing and that in turn to teach the software labeler.... Over the interviewers head... So agile. For the layman ... The software learns at more than. Two orders of magnitude faster than it did last quarter, continuously now..."
316,316,Great interview of one of the world's most complicated humans.
317,317,"Chris, you really bring out the best out of Elon whenever you talk to him."
318,318,"""the future is bright in an energy standpoint"" 
that's sounds better than most peoples: ""The future is bright"""
319,319,Elon is an awesome human being. People tend to define him in terms of his wealth but in reality I think money is just a means to an end for him. Every couple of hundred years or so someone like him comes along to propel humanity forwards.
320,320,"Chris Anderson does a wonderful job in this video, with good, serious questions that drew good, articulate answers from Elon Musk.

But..."
321,321,Great set of questions!
322,322,Proud to work at Tesla.
323,323,"Probably the most inspiring person of this century displaying his endless love and hope for humanity. 
Such a great example for the rest of us.
Thanks for my kids Elon!"
324,324,"if time is not a constraint, can we please allow him to finish his thoughts/sentences without asking leading questions?He answers every question in such great detail with all his thought, we should wait for few seconds after he finished to ask next one!"
325,325,Amazing. Thought provoking and  optimistic.
326,326,It's not hard to have a surface level knowledge on a lot of subjects. Not so to be able to go deep across all those subjects.
327,327,Amazing! - 1000 Ships every 2 Years.... Love the vision!
328,328,"Why aren't they talking to the scientists that created it?
Elon Musk is just a business man"
329,329,"Elon: ~complains about timeline predictions and repercussios
Interviewer: ~proceeds, for the rest of the interview, to ask about timeline predictions"
330,330,"Elon, if you read this, I think that you are mistaken on two things. First, nations now will place a much greater emphasis on nuclear power than they world before the UK and the USA reneged upon their commitment to defend Ukraine. I strongly support nuclear energy because we need nuclear technology to go space. Wind and solar energy technology will not achieve that objective. That acknowledged, nations will want nuclear power for nuclear weapons because they cannot now rely upon the great powers to honor their commitment to defend weaker nations. Second, a battery with a large energy density is, (by definition), a bomb. In a world in which small nations seek weapons to defend themselves against big nations, batteries with a large energy density (if developed), WILL be used as bombs.  Instead, we need a thing that will produce the relatively small amounts of electrical energy that we need when we need that energy. We have had that technology for about 50 years. It does not consume fuel. It is environmentally friendly. It is compact. It can be scaled to be large or small in size and in power. It is well proven technology. It is inexpensive. We have only to decide to use that technology."
331,331,This is a masterpiece of an interview. Thank you Chris and thank you Elon!
332,332,I will be Cybersecurity for these robots one day!
333,333,"I have hope that we can someday figure out self driving but, lets face it, the human construct is such a complicated thing itself, it begs the question. How can we create AI to shadow the human brain if we have not even figured out how the human brain works 100%? There are so many factors when it comes to controlling a vehicle, its almost like there is a spiritual hand helping us along the way to keep us in check...i.e. intuition.. Does anyone know what i am talking about? Don't get me wrong, Elon is amazing and technology at this point is incredible, but to really dial A.I. down to the human construct itself seems just outright impossible.... my opinion... but if anyone is open to comment, please be my guest. thank you."
334,334,"""Roses Are Red, Violets are Blue.... Whatever Elon predicts eventfully comes True""......   It helps that he is the one shaping the future.... Thankfully !."
335,335,"""the best way to predict the future is to create it"" - abraham lincoln, probably"
336,336,"I think the message we have to take is that future is not bad as it seems especially from social media or news but also need to take actions and steps to make it better, small or big doesn't matter. That should be our goal. If ure depressed (unless very serious) u not only should think positively but also do actions to create better future. It's like saying of ""U won't be always motivated but u can always take actions which motivate u"". Plus being depressed or pessimistic won't achieve the goal, it certainly can help but u know what I mean."
337,337,"It's a great interview, which got me thinking about things far from the everyday reality we live in.  He is a wonderful man.  If you want to make something, don't just sit and talk, get it done."
338,338,do tesla's at least know where other teslas are on the road regarding speed/position etc? so as to make a safer driving environment?
339,339,"Elon is a perfect example for never giving up on ur dreams,he just constantly being consistent with his dreams as well as managing side by side other activities,hats off to that Elon"
340,340,"how is hydroelectric power not at the top of his sustainable energy generation list?

also, the emphasis on lithium ion batteries is overstated. a simple dam can store an incredible amount of kinetic potential energy!"
341,341,"I appreciate Tesla's positive and innovative attitude, but these AI vehicles will never replace the real time human judgement, in traffick, sorry. I suspect there will be many accidents, to the public's chagrine. As far as our Climate future, would Elon please influence these chemical companies and Congress ruining our natural weather patterns through their geoengineering? These nanoparticles, strontium, barium and aluminum is accelerating fires, polluting our waters, fish, crops, ozone and brains. Our future is as short as four years, unless we pounce on these practices."
342,342,We Love Elon.
343,343,"Just discussing ""the people of mars"" in my lifetime blows my mind!"
344,344,Great interview
345,345,Thank you Elon for making the worlds EV transportation and space travel future a reality!
346,346,There will always be scarcity because there are always people who's lives are built around controlling others.  Scarcity is a tool for controlling others.
347,347,thank god this guy is in charge!!!
348,348,"The issue is not Elon. Its the world around Elon.

Elon says... ""But this really will be a world of abundance, any goods and services will be available to anyone who wants them..."""
349,349,"""Im not one of the doomsday people..."" 
Amen brother."
350,350,How fortunate are we to share the planet with this unreal gem of a person 
351,351,"Great interview, thank you, and thank you Elon, as usual, for everything you're doing!"
352,352,"One of the loopholes in the climate change area is the biofuels. The fanatics like Greta want absolute zero, but the scientists and the politicians consider it to be part of the carbon cycle, not fossilized carbon being added back into the system. 
That means that planes could quite easily run on bio jetfuel, its a tech issue. So for example, battery powered passenger flight is likely quite a way away still i think. The equivalent of bio-kerosene will be used instead, and it wont be considered a climate change problem. "
353,353,maybe it's just me but I still don't see the great benefit of self-driving cars instead focus should be on the quality and more efficient mass transportation. it makes no difference whether you're driving the car or self-driving you're still stuck in the same traffic not the mention the fact that 90 % of the time cars are driven by 1 person while the cars still have space for 4 more people.
354,354,TED knoiws how to do this things. And Musk knows how to envision the future.
355,355,Going to mars is a once in a life time chance literally
356,356,"If we are it, if we are the only living planet in all of Space.. that is more terrifying than finding planets with life forms."
357,357,I wish I could give a double like. What a wonderful interview. So well executed by the interviewer. Thank you Ted!
358,358,I am looking forward to the future. Great insight from Elon himself.
359,359,A great interview that will be remembered for a long time.
360,360,Elon is the world leader we need
361,361,"<I will always smash the like button on your content!

362,362,"if AI would really get into singularity the first think it would do is going into space there it have solar power, space, and no heat problems also it can hide really easy there"
363,363,"Tesla is done for our family. The moment he spat on the plate that fed him and propelled Tesla to what it is today (California). Worse, he has no shame about the politics of TX. Luckily, there are plenty of choices from new CA startups."
364,364,This is the Elon we like
365,365,What a wonderful interview. Great insight!
366,366,"12:00 (~) One possible note of good news WRT FSD: This being something that has never been done before, the initial system that achieves true adequacy will necessarily be staggeringly complex. As time goes on, and more is learned, it may be possible to simplify certain elements substantially. I have no specific examples, and this is just a hunch. But it's a possibility I think should be kept in mind."
367,367,"I’m excited about the future. Anytime this man is interviewed, I get lost in a dream once again and reignite that passion.."

375,375,Trust Elon he never gets it wrong 
376,376,"Elon and friends here is my loose interpretation of this interview. Keep in mind please, it’s just for fun and for a joke.  Elon “ OK we’re going to need oil, we’re gonna need a battery, we’re going to need electrons, we’re going to need gasoline, we’re gonna need etc. etc. to solve these complicated issues.  Also let me mention I happen sell all of those things so we’re good LOL"
377,377,Great interview with great and current questions. Props to the host.
378,378,I am impressed about the heli on mars how fast. You get there is unusual.  Land is faster.
379,379,"I was always told you can accomplish anything if you put your mind to it.   Never put an emotion on money.  Save your emotions for your friends, family, the dog, and our future!  Doing the right thing isn't always the cool thing, although it does have a more meaningful impact.  Thank you Elon for everything you've done so far to help our planet."
380,380,"Man of the Millennium. 
The Da Vinci of our time."
381,381,"Love Elon's response to a mischaracterized question, I have been hearing about global cooling, uh global warming, uh I mean climate change most of my 62 year life, it's a bullshit question, but I love his answer!"
382,382,In Musk I trust =D
383,383,The greatest fermi paradox filter may be the lack of humanity’s desire to continue to replicate at an increasing rate.
384,384,22:12 I imagine someone in the future during a robot war watching this video and shouting: Stop this man!!!
385,385,thank you!!! and thank god we live in this era along side Mr. Elon Musk
386,386,"Nuclear is by far the best option for electricity generation, environmentally. Thorium MSRs (AKA LFTRs) are the way to go."
387,387,"Interviewers nowadays are obsessed with asserting control and so eager to be standout or sound smart with dumb interruptions that nobody cares about. However, this, was great."
388,388,Earning money by honest work is philantropy. The richer you are - the more good you did to others. Our goal is to set the rules of the game right.
389,389,Elon talking about humanity resolving the sustainable energy problem like he's from the futur... WAIT
390,390,This was brilliantly done. Great questions and research leading to an enlightening discussion. Thank you.
391,391,The most exiting part of this entire interview is definitely the cat girls . Thank you elon
392,392,"Many scientists out there believe 
There's  a solid chance we are actually in a c02  deficit and the emissions of  vehicles ECT are barely covering  what we need for the climate to remain close to current levels!!"
393,393,"Elon Musk has many ""initiatives"", many ""dreams"", his ""radical new innovations he's working on"", but where is the removal of sin or imperfection that leads to sickness and death ? He touts his ""expertise"" in many fields of endeavor. "
394,394,"1:01:49  How does he have less hours to work if he's not using his plane? He really doesn't need his plane when he can make deals calling people on the phone, or hire other people to get results for him."
395,395,"""It is harder to create laws than to get rid of them"""
396,396,10% of the required battery capacity is still amazing for one company.
397,397,A big win for common sense and logic.
398,398,"What an excellent interviewer. Very knowledgable about your subject, didn't put the subject on guard, and the whole thing just flowed very naturally. A real pro."
399,399,Elon seems to still think people will be rich even when they can't get a job but also doesn't want to give up his own money to people who will be put out of work by large companies using automation.
400,400,Imagine a truck driver that drives from the Atlantic to the Pacific without stopping at the time when humans usually sleep. Makes more amazon humane I guess?
401,401,"I bet this guy has a lot of Tesla stock, asking so many questions "
402,402,"That Elon guy seems really intelligent, definitely a bit above average. J/K this man is a hero. His hero to freedom free-speech. He is an anti-liberal."
403,403,that was amazing!!!
404,404,"The more interviews I watch of Elon being interviewed, the more I like him."
405,405,"I do love humanity, but I also want to get rid of realities opression. Injuries, sickness, death, limited mind, limited everything. We need to become more. I feel that drive every day. Please let me nurture it to help myself and others, become far better all the time."
406,406,Here's a concept. Hear me out. Instead of all the wasted fuel to get into space use reusable balloons to lift into orbit. Balloons can deflate and float back with drone assisted landing.
407,407,Best interview
408,408,"30:00 Now I start to wonder: If I took my digital ghost and put it out in some suitable forum, and could somehow convince everyone that it was associated with some unspecified *DEAD* person, would people maybe then finally take it seriously?"
409,409,protect Elon musk at all cost
410,410,Wow! one of the best interviews i have seen. Chris did an awesome job. He is so knowledgeable and prepared he really moved the discussion along to dig out new things from Elon
411,411,"You are not limited to batteries for storing energy... water resoirs, pressure tanks and fly wheels are all valid and actually in use alternatives."
412,412,Well at least someone is thinking positive at the moment!
413,413,"if you’re against billionaires being allowed to develop that much wealth then just ask yourself this quistion, are you capable and willing to do what he does?"
414,414,"I always have such a hard time to listen and follow elon musk the way he speaks. He lightly stutters between words and uses the word ""uhm"" a lot. Don't get me wrong the guy obviously is one of the biggest entrepreneurial genius this world has ever seen, but on a communicative level I always find myself having to concentrate on his way way of bringing his sentences."
415,415,He could help our future out by paying his taxes.
416,416,"This is the best interview with Elon I have seen. Imposissible not to agree with him, he's vision is amacing ️"
417,417,Pay the working class more so they can afford the dreams of having children. You can’t expect a person to not want kids when they know they can’t afford it due to inflation and wage stagnations.
418,418,"Watching this makes me motivated and excited about the future, thanks for this informational video!"
419,419,"This guy supports NASA more than SPACEX because he saw NASA land on the moon and never saw SPACEX land on the moon.
This is not called bias. This is called logical proof based analysis."
420,420,"I can’t say that I don’t see the advantage to going clean, not green. This is what I don’t understand. The very fact that this company’s name is Tesla is an oxymoron. Tesla’s energy would truly be clean through and through. No one is talking about the battery nightmare that will accumulate after they are spent. No one is talking about where all the batteries are going to be made and where all the elements that are needed are NOT on our continent. That makes us completely "
421,421,"Investing in the stock market is the best option to make
a passive income. Virtually all the markets are crazy
most people pay more attention to the shiniest position
on the graph, I'm keeping a diversified portfolio"
422,422,"""One time payment of 25k?"" Doubt it. They'll put the robot on a subscription like everything else these days"
423,423,Thank you Elon Musk
424,424,"Really interesting view of future. We always talk about how society can be good in the future passively, but Musk is a man who is working directly on multiple fronts to make those good happen. Not just in a small way like many people who pitch lofty dreams to a TED talk, but in a massively productive way thats having meaningful impact. Still there are malicious forces that intent on stopping him because of their own personal insecurities."
425,425,"I like Elon, but Elon I suggest highly that you go on a defensive driving courses to see why the human will always be better than a copy. I can not tell you how many times I have had to rely on my extensive experience driving. In spin out situations no car could quickly adjust to not to hit something in tight spaces and like I can in real time.  Frankly I trust my driving skills over an automated car every single time. In fact if this was not the case DUIs in self drive cars would no longer be issued if the cars could fully drove in the same way as an uber driver. Keep striving however I would like to see that happen despite the fact I prefer to be in control of a car myself. I am a firm believer in progress done right. That said Neurolink is too invasive. I mean if you could fix people who had a stroke or were disabled etc. most people would understand Nuerolink otherwise it sounds like giving people who could control Neurolink too much control. You can definitely do incredible damage ethically and physically if you could use Nuerolink with ill intentions. Man is filled with ill intentions."
426,426,"it is really fascinating to see how the world and the AI are developing but surely there is a negative side to this entire thing, people are losing jobs and also truck of the world, human interactions are becoming really rare and plus you will find those people who are simply not catching up with everything anymore, for example talking about the robot talking to the grandma, well surely she won't want seeing pictures rather she will love talking to that person who asked the robot to show her the pictures."
427,427,"yeah this is what it has come to - billionaires interviewing ""themselves"" on TED"
428,428,The love ......is the greatest thing what we have
429,429,"You hate him or love him, but you can't ignore him!"
430,430,I am very grateful to live during the time of Elon Musk. He's inspiring me to think and to act. What a person!
431,431,Gordo holds onto a lot of things Elon says…. “Elon says this would happen” is pretty much all he says. LMAO
432,432,"I can't help but love Elons outlook on solutions rather than dithering. 
You go Elon! Love the entire Tesla range."
433,433,"12:38 He should have said ""the probability of not having an accident""."
434,434,"I agree with Elon on everything but the birthrate thing, where is live seems overpopulated af and continues to get worse."
435,435,Texas LOVES you Elon!! 
436,436,Love his positive attitude. It would be great if people would utilize their intelligence to become innovative rather than complain. Provide solutions and stay positive.
437,437,Without the insight of emotion AI will only solve metrics.
438,438,"An interviewer who's intelligent, curious, polite and amicable. a welcome surprise!"
439,439,"I wonder what percentage of this ""consensus"" of scientists has been subject to coercion in forming their ""scientific"" opinion."
440,440,"Firstly well done Chris  great interview. Secondly Elon did very well with his answers so well done also.
Thirdly and lastly and this has nothing to do with the interview. Jeff who??"
441,441,"""The only scarcity that will exist in the future is that which we decide to create ourselves as humans."""
442,442,I like the human-electronics tattoo interface depicted in Pandoras Star by Peter f. hamilton. Maybe that could be possible some day. Electronics as kind of tattoos under the skin.
443,443,But the question humanity needs to know: Can we build dancing robots?
444,444,"Elon is such a fucking awesome human, we are so lucky to have him. You're why most people feel confident in our future"
445,445,"Yeah, ofc. Elon Musk is telling us that electric is our future. He invested heavily in this, could say that his success or failure depends on electric.
I see it differently. In the last 30 years we were waiting for a breakthrough in the technology. Today we have the exact same problems - batteries are too heavy, too slow to charge, and too expensive to be economic. Every month there is news of some breakthrough, but nothing ever changes when you check the merchandise."
446,446,"""Population collapse"" Are you insane? If 90% of humans disappeared tomorrow there would still be way too many people. What has population growth done? Destroyed other species, caused global warming past the tipping point, deforestation, viruses, ecosystem collapse. I'm a Musk fan but that point of view that there needs to be MORE people is insane."
447,447,"He needs to starts saying ""it can be done in the next 6 months"" rather than "" it will be done in the next 6 months"""
448,448,best blessing and great success wish to you elon
449,449,"If I ever had an Hero, I guess it would be Elon Musk. And Im not the kind to have hero :p"
450,450,"When he mentioned the stories they're receiving at Neuralink, he really showed his motivation and drive. Good on you Elon ️"
451,451,"I do have some remarks about that interview:
First, thank you both for that great interview.
1. The important thing is that the log-curves stack, to reach the next higher local maxima. I mean a lot of progress is achived by first piling up mere quantity (shallow part of the log curve) before the next quality step appears (steep part)."
452,452,"I hope all of this sustainable electric grid is EMP hardened. If not, the consequences will be worse than any of the proposed dangers of climate change. Electric grids (and individual solar powered homes) could be taken down in a second by an EMP surge (nuclear blast in the upper atmosphere or massive solar flares)."
453,453,Elon trying to cure schizophrenia - “I want to put a microchip in your brain”
454,454,Has anyone given thought to all the batteries that will be going to the landfill if everything goes electric. This sure concerns me.
455,455,"I like Elon, I like his vision and he's intelligent.  What I don't believe is that wind and solar are the answer today, maybe in the future.  EV is great for use case locations.  World wide adoption maybe in 30 years.  My belief is make combustion engines more efficient or alternative fuels and more importantly use of public transportation that is efficient, easy and accessible and that must include high speed electric rail.  USA has Amtrak... seriously?  Reduce by 30% all air travel.  That is by far one of the biggest polluters.  Most Southeast Asian countries and the major cause of air and sea pollution.  This has to stop.  Just look at the air quality in 30 chyna cities.   Japan is doing many things right.  Anyway, human extinction 2050."
456,456,"I have never spent a single day in my life without reading/listening/having a thought about Elon Musk, once I got to know about him. Very few humans on this planet makes you feel positive and excited about the future, Elon Musk is one of the human being who could do it and makes it lot of fun! 🫡"
457,457,Elon you're a badass!
458,458,I thoroughly enjoyed this interview; the questions were well crafted and thoughtful and the answers just as much so.  Thankful to have EM working so hard on these various issues!
459,459,"My question is. I hear Elon talk about direct democracy and how that makes for a happier/better society. Yet, why does he not put his money where his mouth is. Where is his direct democracy at the companies he is in charge of??"
460,460,With all that money shame that Musk doesn't dedicate his life to wireless electricity like the real Nikola Tesla did...if you really wanna change the world ️
461,461,"Elon just used the Chinese motto, and what my parents always say"
462,462,"Batterys made of gold as it can withstand high temperatures and conducts electricity good, and maybe some sort of a high grade silica solar panel to gather the energy, that in a desert = free energy to me."
463,463,"MUSK....A MANS DREAMS AND VISIONS NOW A REALITY THAT WILL HELP MANKIND,EARTH AND PEACE!
The world needs to come together as ONE before Mother Nature takes the earth and it will be DONE!"
464,464,Really good interview. Thanks for putting it together and for Elon for taking so much time out to do it. Very impressive.
465,465,"Hi,
I follow Elon's projects and I hope that God will give Elon more light in his thinking to treat the spinal cord with Nerollink so that I can treat my son. We are waiting and following you and excited that you will reach this goal, we love Elon"
466,466,"for lowering those prices it would be important the huge Lithium deposits in the Donbas region of Ukraine, if sold to Europe and America cheaper than China it would reduce the prices of all technology-related products."
467,467,"12:00 “We’re almost at the point where we have a high quality unified vector space.””

SMh ️ Duh everybody knows that…"
468,468,"This interviewer seems to think that happiness and contentment will be derived from technological innovation. Elon is the closest thing I have to a hero figure -- I hugely respect his genius & determination -- but his (or any other) inventions will not cause human happiness to occur. This type of thinking reminds me of a person who interviewed Sadhguru, asking him how to stop all the ""terrible wars,"" to which Sadhguru replied that first you must erase the hatreds you have in your own heart, and when you and others do THAT you will find the answer. Elon is a genius, but he's not a savior. We need to collectively save ourselves."
469,469,So solar works during the day and can produce hydrogen too. Hydrogen operates in gaps..with batteries.
470,470,"Incredible interview, well done Chris Anderson. Elon was born to change the world forever."
471,471,A future worth getting excited about ^ a future with people
472,472,Elon needs to find the high school kid who explains the 4th dimension
473,473,26:40ish  future labor forces are  like the Printer and computer was to save of wood  But ended up using more  So its hard to predict
474,474,"I think optimus and any robots of the like need to pay income tax for any revenue they generate. And redistribute that to humans. 

Im just concerned about when they get tired of paying taxes and year 11776 happens"
475,475,"I still say ""we are coming out of an Iceage"" ...
Look at the continental shelf from Google Earth,
That is where the beach once was."
476,476,"Best Elon interview I've ever seen, a very relaxed Elon, Chris was excellent and stayed away from the really depressing areas that Elon find hard to shake and move on from during an interview and the future really is bright. Don't let the doomsday crowd get you down.
IMO anyone having watched this interview, still talking bad about Elon has an ulterior motive."
477,477,"I don’t trust any person that wants to put chips in our heads. This dude is 50/50,"
478,478,Never thought I could just sit on my chair and watch an interview for a whole hour without being distracted. This was incredibly interesting.
479,479,"Elon Musk is a genius, so he's a rare kind, but he is like most of us who are 420 conservatives."
480,480,"Remember the dangers for women and children in scenarios of “digital world” and “mars.. “ biology matters- see .. earth. With great power comes great responsibility.. who holds the power? I vote for continuing earth conservation and women’s rights.. we have much to improve here, with much greater resultshappy earth day️"
481,481,thanks Elon! much love my dear friend.
482,482,Rockets seem dangerous. Wish there was a better fuel system that was quieter and more energy efficient for this
483,483,"geniune question here, hope somebody can explain to me , why a lower birthrate is a problem ? ( especialy when robots can do  more and more jobs) 
tnx!"
484,484,"Impecable entrevista. Elon, gracias por dar el ejemplo y sembrar optimismo."
485,485,"If we didn't have to support the government, we could all live very long healthy lives."
486,486,We love you ObElon! You're earths only hope!
487,487,"Trains and Public transportation !!!

This (marketing) genius conveniently forgot to mention the  100 years old electric transportation technology that doesn't need unsustainable mining"
488,488,"i like what elon is saying.. but I think vision of what is used by people being limited to merely vision of eyes and brains is incorrect. I think we also use our other senses, such as hearing and sense of tourch as well.. for example, blind people use hearing and senses of their skin to agment their senses of things around them. there are documentaries showing how blind people use a kind of self generating sonar.. making clicking sound to sense what is around them and how far. Also, experiment with hous you can feel radiating heat. Ofcourse it might not be enogh on its own, but these kinds of sensors are not LIDAR. but in combination with tri-scopic or quad or penta-scopic photo vision, can enhance vision of self driving vehicles. I might even add magnetic compass to allow the car to have sense of its direction. And this could be uitlized whether GPS is working or not, and birds use internal biological compasses to know direction."
489,489,Why is the over-unity permanent magnet motor and early 20th century Tesla tech never on the list?
490,490,"It’s not always easy to feel good about humanity or the future, but Elon’s vision gives me hope."
491,491,I love Elon musk but he's completely wrong about batteries. They have a fundamental maximum energy density that will introduce thermal runaway which is inescapable physical law. Please upvote this if you agree and know it's not that simple.
492,492,For heaven’s sakes- build giant floating docks with massive gear reduction driven generators and use the fricken’ tides to generate electricity- it’s really that easy
493,493,I am one of those people 25 and suffered neck injury 3 years ago lost half my body I have physically done my best to recover but I feel I still have work to do mentally and physically before I achieve that.
494,494,"01:01:00  If you are offended by billionaires simply existing, you are probably not so poor, and the actual poor are likely more critical of you than of a handful of tech tycoons actively making their lives better over time; which they have."
495,495,Elon is the GREATEST
496,496,Every time I hear Elon I’m more and more bullish for humanity. We can definitely solve every problem on Earth and Elon and his companies are doing more good for humanity than any other entities in the world.
497,497,400 Terawats? But you plan on using legions of robots? The 400 Terawats is a prediction for today. The future is going to need a lot more energy.
498,498,"If you want the future to be good, you must make it so!
Thanks Elon and Chris for a wonderful interview."
499,499,With unified vector vision...Wouldn't one need to utilize time crystals...not only where in the vector...when in the vector? Just wondering.  ???
500,500,"How can you not love this man! He is brutally honest, we need more transparency in this world…"
501,501,Why can't a vehicle be protected by a protective energy to keep everything away from it?
502,502,"This is like some ghost in the shell sounding stuff, wild."
503,503,Very impressive guy
504,504,Elon is the greatest visionair of our time. Always amazing to listen too!
505,505,"Elon I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. A what? A BOLT OF LIGHTNING."
506,506,"Great interview.  Elon’s positivity is great and while humanity is capable of overcoming these challenges, we are extremely poor at distributing these innovations and benefits."
507,507,"i'm absolutely not looking forward for the future, and I wished I could go back in time."
508,508,"wish the interviewer would of asked more questions about how it will work the spinal and brain injuries, but i get it theory of AI going left is more interesting"
509,509,Why is this video so focused on Elon's failure to predict a couple timelines? This interviewer failed to ask interesting questions as well.
510,510,Amazing interview! Elon always has the most intelligent and exciting ideas. Without changing tone once.
511,511,"Once he grants nuclear, there's no real need for wind, solar, or batteries, at least batteries at grid scale."
512,512,As a South African from the West Rand I wish you all the best good Sir.
513,513,"Why is it they never talk about the importance of fossil fuels in the production of clean energy. No oil, no electric cars, no windmills, no solar power. Maybe sometime in the way distant future. The current infrastructure will not support the amount of electric cars on the road today without issues. Again, no issues with clean energy, tons of issues with the clear omissions in this conversation. We will reach 100% clean energy, but no one watching this will see that day."
514,514,"As long as you buy a Tesla, the future is going to be great, don’t worry about it.  Don’t ask any questions about climate models either.  Lol, Elon himself said that the human climate change theory is NOT proven."
515,515,"1:25 It's not about how large the consensus is, it's about what the facts are. When are you getting it straight?"
516,516,I love how optimistic Elon is really gives me hope !
517,517,Anyone would recommend a book that talks about the predictions and enterpirses of Elon Musk? Thank you
518,518,"Great interview. Very good questions! I really liked how Elon said that he is worth a lot of money, but the way he look at it is the consumption rate. If his consumption rate was a billion times higher than the average of people, that would be a problem. But he doesn't even own a house. He stays at friends' houses, doesn't own a yacht, and don't really take vacations. The only reason he uses a plane is so that he can spend more time working."
519,519,"What about the sourcing of minerals like cobalt? We need to also address a better world for indigenous/ African people in 2050 so that people aren’t being exploited for electric cars, boats, rocket ships."
520,520,"By understanding the nature of the universe, we don't increase a chance of understanding why we are here"
521,521,He is  one  smart  person
522,522,"A future worth getting excited about is a future without climate change, not a future where billionaires can holiday on the moon."
523,523,YouTube should replace all adverts with this video for one day... just for the benefit of the world 
524,524,"""Well, I think if you want the future to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good, and it will be."""
525,525,You're lonely must seem to be a righteous guy he seems to be on the right side of the issues on the right side for America and that is that is a rare attribute these days. I hope in the future that it comes to me the fact that he is in fact looking out for free speech I so hope he is.
526,526,Floating high atmosphere domes on Venus.... Ship Optimus 'space edition' to the millions of things in Jupiter's L1 and L2. Not to mention our own L1 and L2
527,527,When it comes to the the AI driving it all comes down to how dumb are the other drivers.
528,528,I want a major move with AI to fix people with mental health issues 
529,529,️ Elon
530,530,"This man is a genius!
Negative comments are being made by people that haven’t improved society or life ….
This person should be more than appreciated!"
531,531,I am also interested to hear whether he feels sad and unhappy sometimes? .... just as a normal human being.
532,532,"I remember someone from the navy, i think that short AO1 with all the knowledge of naval tradition said it, something about the missing logic in Hal-9000 from A Space Odyssey. I have ""do not follow them. Let them fail."" As my unrecognized missing logic, among other things crippling my behavior. THAT at least though, would be what he hoped to learn from me about what it all meant? Thanks. Good trade?  Judas' main grab at winning a earthly host, loyal and protecting of him from God even if they dont realize it, is probably the secret jim attempts to continue carrying. And since jim mentioned that ""disney"" interrogate him once, and took his secret about being MY nemisis for whatever thing. IS probably this topic of avoiding God and encouraging exercise at anyone's expense involved that needs it.  Disney bought his ticket onto Judas' team then, for drugging him? Or he gets a mulligan?  Do not let a earthly host keep judas or elon or anyone else from God's angels questioning them. IT will be a debt I get to recover from, that I need as much from God. That we need as much from God. But I can afford this much. Tell me good stories of your time in the grand games while we watch them at a league game at Angel stadium while I hold a clipboard on my lap about other things i need tending?"
533,533,Elon is a real life Clovis Bray.
534,534,The world needs a bunch more elons all just making stuff and to better humanity
535,535,Man of the century.
536,536,"It's always inspiring to hear his thoughts. It is important to have a positive future in our minds. If we look around and see the current situation both economically and from many perspectives, it can be quite distressing, but I want to believe in a positive future as well. Thank you for this deep and inspiring interview!"
537,537,I could be optimistic about the future if I could be optimistic about the people. We have got to stop electing climate change deniers for public office.
538,538,I love how his eyes move all around when he is charging ideas. And he’s a very inviting person. I wish your dreams come through also.
539,539,Optimus will come in various versions. One will be cheaper and less advanced.  The other will be badass and super capable. That version needs to be called “Prime”.
540,540,"Neurolink after ""at least a decade"" is gonna be like a light switch... Kind of like that insane berserker kill scene in the movie ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" with Samuel Jackson.... Who remembers that movie?! hahaha"
541,541,"You realize that in a million years someone will go through these comments and say so all these where people before us and are all gone...

We have one life and we all need to use it for greatness.. And help the poor"
542,542,"Well that interview just cost Tesla $66,000,000

Must be the most expensive interview ever.  But I loved the journey (at $1m per minute)"
543,543,"The fact is BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselve now if this is the right time to invest? Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days the price of BTC been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can't tell if its going bearish or bullish. While others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose others are being patient. It all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me. I started with 2.5 BTC and I have accumulated over 17.6 BTC in just three weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by Expert trader "
544,544,"Thank you Elon.
The future will be good; to a significant extent due to your actions and inspiration."
545,545,"If we’re going to use batteries, then we need easily replaceable batteries. I can swap out the battery on my lawnmower and use it in my edger while I charge up some extras. Meanwhile, Tesla owners are waiting hours for their cars to charge their internal battery that will eventually degrade turning the entire vehicle into junk. You call that “sustainable”?"
546,546,seems like everyone is volunteering into becoming a robot lol
547,547,"1:04:28 The meaning of life, is to give life a meaning."
548,548,The issue with population collapse is self loathing. Empower Mother love.
549,549,A robot Cat Girl! I'm so down for that :-)
550,550,Thanks TED and Elon for this amazing interview
551,551,if he doesn't want people to call him a liar then he shouldn't have defended his actions in the bail out pf Solar City tbh
552,552,it's fascinating to me that the interviewer asked such relevant questions of which I thought about just minutes before he asked them. Very well done
553,553,Just one problem he has forgotten that it is carbon that makes it possible for us to exist and that carbon has to be in the air the only thing that's going to happen is the Earth is going to become greener
554,554,His arguments are fundamentally flawed. Batteries are incredibly polluting to make and not sustainable. The way forwards is to produce hydrogen from molten salt nuclear power stations. And to use the hydrogen as fuel and also to produce electricity.
555,555,Notice he didn't mention hydrogen fuel cell - he's a salesman
556,556,"Thanks Ted & Chris, brilliant interview with Elon. Exploring & colonising is our past, present & future...it's just what we do s a species, we move to better ourselves...fall in love, change location, change job. If there is n opportunity elsewhere brave people will endeavour to change & go despite risk."
557,557,Love the true dedication to make this world a better place for us and our future generation!! Thanks Elon!!
558,558,"""If we cared more about the actual love of humanity vs the perception of it"" SO TRUE "
559,559,Amazing interview with two amazing guys! I hope he can manage to donate to some children in Yemen. Such a small amount of his wealth would make such a large difference to them. Can he take a measly 1 billion a year and just split it between various malnourished children worldwide?
560,560,14:45 the interviewer just interrupted the genius who unintentionally teaching us laymen how Tesla AI works. Instead  he forced him to dumb down the information. I'm annoyed!
561,561,Robots will explore the universe.
562,562,I them both! 
563,563,The problem comes when the one offering the future also pollutes the future... giga factory.
564,564,Worldclass editing. Period. It made it one of the best EM interviews to date. Applaud!
565,565,49:57 Speaking directly to the future Martians
566,566,Interesting Interview.   Valuable Conversation.       April 23rd 2022.
567,567,"Elon!!!!    I'll sign up on your platform

 ""Build it and they will come""
     - Jeff Francis"
568,568,"There are many “liberal” reasons to be sceptical, depressed and angry for this future"
569,569,"We will see robots in army first for sure, not at homes for retail customers. And only in scenario when nuclear war won’t happen"
570,570,I don’t think I blinked once this whole hour video! Very well thought out interview! Thank you host and thank you Elon for putting every waking hour in the thoughts of human sustainability. I hope to one day be a part of your mission and possibly help you reach those goals.
571,571,Ted speaks to one of its gods.
572,572,"12:14 - He's either absolutely stupid... or holding a secret. On solving AI for self driving cars, he essentially says they are attempting to navigate a 3 dimensional environment with 2 dimensional input (photographs). That is an absurd approach. Further more he elaborates into verbose technological terms. 
I don't claim to have the answers but I know it not to be through pictures which can never have reliable depth perception as even human eyes do not."
573,573,Everybody wants to know whats the climate is in 20 years. I just wanna know how much TESLA stocks are in 20 years.
574,574,"First for this to work is the switch every person as to have that special car, at the same time, or it won't work if people are around and danger of others still driving. It's  Great Idea for future, talk about neat people movers is Disneyland's Montarail."
575,575,500 thousand cars??? That makes perfect sense when you consider THE REALITY that their manufacture was 95% taxpayer funded!!  Ask any TESLA owner how many subsidies are given JUST TO THE CONSUMER!!!!
576,576,The interviewer is smart. And that makes it an interesting conversation
577,577,Fascinating!
578,578,"How is a single person pushing all resources to make every sci-fi vision a reality... it's ridiculous: cyborgs, self driving cars, space colonization, robot buddies, AI... amazing.."
579,579,"Elon Musk - the definition of ""over- promise, under-deliver""."
580,580,It's hard not to be pessimistic when the cost of living has sky rocketed and the world is burning.
581,581,"23:39 Cannot be updated remotely. Well that means ""cannot be hacked"". The hack prevention problem is not solved. So the dystopian concern is indeed alarming."
582,582,"This guy is no Joe Rogan
9:00 you want us thinking, “you already are annoying.”
9:10 “How come so many things are amazing on the money and others are not?” Is that a real question? The question was so inane that Elon could not answer it right away. Like 10 seconds later he says, “believe it or not I’m not always right.”"
583,583,What quantum leap in use conceptually could be made with Twitter?
584,584,"Wow! 
What a great interview & points discussed. Keep going Mr Elon"
585,585,Go get them Elon a man that uses his wealth to better his home land he’s no.#1 in my book he’s the only one that is with Mr president Trump with these two we cannot lose god bless America and god bless the American people keep up the grate work take the country back I stand with you two all the way
586,586,"I wish Chris can dig deeper with his questions based on Elon’s answer. They are trying to cover too many things without an hour. Plus, who cares if Elon minds the haters or not?! Doubt he would give a F**k about them. Haters will be haters."
587,587,Do we know if Elon's chipped? Fantastic interview
588,588,Hmm sending a submarine to the oceans of Europa sounds a great idea. I bet when Chris said that to Elon Elon said to himself either what a great idea or he said hihihiiii we're already on it chief.
589,589,"Subtitles, please!!! "
590,590,This man is actually making sci-fi become true.
591,591,How do we dispose of batteries to be environmentally safe? Let's talk about toxicity regarding batteries.
592,592,Best video to show people if they are BRAINWASHED into hating Musk.
593,593,"Its crazy but our current technology can easily allow something that insane... we just need to build and work to get it done... i would like to work for better future but unfortunately, i have to work for someone else and survive.... what a sad and useless life i have..."
594,594,His mind is just incredible
595,595,"I wish he would ask the people what would make their life better.  (talk about ""direct democracy"")  For example, I'd rather him invent ""free energy"" rather than invest in ""sustainable energy"". We all know what would happen if he did that so instead just invent a refrigerator/stove/dishwasher/washer/dryer/lawn mower that lasts longer than 2 years!!!"
596,596,Such a well rounded interview truly asking relevant and critical questions!!!
597,597,one way or other i can do something at my own scale atleast even if i get backlash.
598,598,great interview and exciting updates from Elon! 
599,599,"I'm no Luddite, but I'm not buying the self-driving capabilities.  Even if the accident rate can reach less than that of those involving human drivers, there is still the massive question of liability for damage to property and human life.  Everything from sensor degradation, failed maintenance and replacement schedules, uncontrollable weather variables and solar storm effects will create, if scaled up enough, an endless string of conflicts and lawsuits against corporations armed to the teeth with  superstar legal teams extremely well versed in shirking responsibility and heaping great pain on the victims of this technology."
600,600,his fans and critics are both correct about him
601,601,Go Elon
602,602,"How boring these mundane interviews with Elon Musk are when interviewers have so little understanding about electronics and basic programming.

They are mostly concerned with time lines, opinions, superficial concerns."
603,603,Chris Anderson looks like Elon Musk on 20 years
604,604,"""If you want the future to be good, you must make it so; take action to make it so, and it will be. "" 1:06:00 to the end. I love this man for restoring my faith in humanity."
605,605,"Where's the questions on ""right to repair""?  How many people in these comments are getting a brain implant, that Elon will only let you get checked for malfunctions at an authorized Neuralink sales and service center?  Tesla software updates have been 100% flawless with absolutely zero bugs, what could possibly go wrong with a brain implant!"
606,606,"All intelligence organic or artificial are subject to dark and light forces. We would need to learn to monitor Chaos...as in the Chaos....deterministic nonlinear systems. What would be the immediate monitoring system? How would the predictability of length be handled?   What would happen to a human brain if the causative factor was the superintelligence device.  How would you keep the superintelligence from becoming self-aware? How would that play out in the human host?  I see the potential for good. I also know Chaos does exist. There is always a balance of dark and light. What the action or knee jerk re-action is...from either super AI or human cannot easily be deterministic.  Would nano technology be involved in implanting superintelligence into humans?  What about personality changes? I like myself; I am my favorite human.  I grew up in the age of 'question everything'. So, I am compelled to ask."
607,607,"Elon Musk "" This will be a world of abundance"" "
608,608,One of the greatest thinkers of the century.. his views and attitude are exactly what’s needed..
609,609,"When taking time for this conversation, please let the speaker finish the explanation. Thanks!! @16:05"
610,610,What a gift is to be able to live life at the same age of this human.
611,611,"You’re in a very privileged position Elon, in part due to the subsidies your companies have received. Don’t be a fuckwit and accept government and regulation are the only levers us working people have to have some say in the future of this planet. We can’t just rely on well-meaning, entrepreneurial billionaires."
612,612,I’d like to know what elons take is on graphene batteries
613,613,Go Elon.
614,614,"Is the goal elimination of photosynthesis?  If so, what will replace plants?"
615,615,"Our brains are routers, our children are the receiving devices."
616,616,"Superb interview.
Really insightful and empowering too.
Touched on all the key topics."
617,617,"""Be careful that no man deceives you."" "
618,618,The mental image of seeing 1000 starships launch to Mars at once is just beautiful. Incredible.
619,619,"Elon Musk is literally our future. The humbleness, interest in human survival, etc. just leave me in awe."
620,620,The multiview camera description reminds me of a fly or spider with multiple eyes.  I still can't get over scallops having 200 eyes 
621,621,"""take action. If you want the future to be good you must make it so""
I'm heavily censored by people from your billionaire class and am not in charge of anything to make anything so. Great advice but I cant even grow any kind of following or make money because of that."
622,622,Has anyone without any prior brain issues begun experiencing terrifying focal or generalized seizures or seizure auras in or around 2020? Late third quarter or early fourth quarter in particular.
623,623,"The most exciting fact about the future is, that 95% of humans and families don't have one .."
624,624,"You know when your looking at someone alive and you know people will know their name in a 1000 years time, its like watching Julius Caesar ..it amazes me to be in this same time with such a man, to watch him work, try and understand how he thinks... sorry iv always been a fan boy, I make no apology."
625,625,"When Elon is talking about the robots. He does not make clear how much shortage of labor and how many jobs there are that are not filled because labor is costly. Lets take a few examples. Cleaning up trash pretty much anywhere, trimming the trillions of trees and removing hazards of brush that can cause fires. Cleaning up abandoned places, salvaging lumber from abandoned buildings. Sorting and recycling trash, cleaning up the oceans, rivers, creeks. Reclamation work, fixing errosion problems. Pulling weeds, tending to barb wire fence, Tending to animals, there is a need for trillions of these bots. There should be at least 10 to 50 robot human people for every human."
626,626,We could have android soldiers who never need sleep. What fantastic wars we could have.
627,627,wassent this guy saying that AI was the devil last year. seems he changed his tune.
628,628,"We need the ""Fairness Doctrine"" reenacted and applied across all media platforms.
The killing of the ""fairness doctrine"" by Ronald Reagan led to the polarized country beyond repair, beyond recognition.
We must make the Fairness Doctrine THE law to be imposed on EVERY MEDIA PLATFORM."
629,629,How about SpaceX the private company and SpaceX-II the publicly traded company?
630,630,Fantastic interview. Elon is one of the most important people on planet Earth right now
631,631,"Starting early is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority. The stock market/crypto market has plenty of opportunities to earn a decent payout even in a downtrend, with the right skills and proper understanding of how the market works."
632,632,"It was a very rude and bordering on stupid question to ask why Elon’s projected FSD date didn’t hit the mark, whereas his # of cars projection hit the mark.  You’re comparing apples to oranges.  And I can’t believe I even have to explain this, FSD is technology still in the making, whereas auto production is already under way and therefore much easier to predict!"
633,633,17:45 This is the year..Elon finds a hairstyle suitable to a billionaire.
634,634,The only thing keeping me alive right now is the possibility of robot cat girls
635,635,Each person can plant a tree every year.. start with simple things…
636,636,Chris Anderson is such a great interviewer! Really enjoyed this one.
637,637,Never imagined Andy Bernard would become the richest man on earth.
638,638,"Imagine feeling anything other than gratitude and respect for what this man has achieved, and why he did it"
639,639,"Mar will be the best place for mining solution, and not living on the early stage of development since temperture control will be very difficult. Moon will be good for tourism."
640,640,"Plants take 'deadly' carbon dioxide out of the air and they use it to make oxygen which is what animals need in the air to breathe, believe it or not. -marc27"
641,641,Forgot to mention Starlink which is going to make a lot of money.
642,642,"It is only Falcon 9 now, it is ok. It takes times to be the Millennium Falcon."
643,643,Can someone explain how when our population keeps increasing that we are on any verge of population collapse
644,644,Amazing interview. This really gave me hope for the future when everything seems so bleak
645,645,"We are watching and learning from the most brilliant man since Einstein. God Bless Elon Musk. We need more leaders like him in all industries... but for better or worse, he is a truly unique individual."
646,646,"This is why I can't figure you out, Elon. Where do you stand, really? is it the good of the people, or your wallet, really? ...how much more money and fame do you need? When is enough? Are you capable of compassion?"
647,647,"Elon Musk:
Personaly, you are the pillar of our furure, RESPECT for that and congrats for all you have been thrue to be whom you are today...NEVER STOP! NO ONE ELSE WILL DO WHAT YOU DO AMD HOW YOU DO.
 But my question is..."
648,648,"JOAN CRAWFORD reincarnated!  Stay strong  Johnny Depp, we believe you!   Elon Musk dodged a bullet!"
649,649,Great man
650,650,"Thanks Elon, working towards our dreams provides the solutions, for escaping our nightmares."
651,651,"Neuralink can perhaps connect us to the neural net and restructure the Rapture into something a little less gruesome than we have been led to expect over the past couple of thousand years. Wow! That must mean God really does Love us. Dig it, Al!"""
652,652,Wind is causing problems though.  How do you account for the birds to keeps them from dying in mass?
653,653,In other words we need more time and time is finite
654,654,This dude mocks our intelligence and he signals to others who know he is acting on a world stage
655,655,I wish everyone who criticizes this man would watch this.
656,656,Excellent interview. Your questions were spot-on and well-targeted.
657,657,I wish  Elon to   identify potential  places on the  earth  and take  up  a project to plant  a billion tress in the next decade or so- a perfect  way  for carbon sequestration. Eon please .. you have the money  .. all you need is WILL
658,658,"This interview is quite mind bending in its scope - the topics and considerations are momentous and should be heard by every thoughtful, rational, and altruistic soul on planet earth.  Others should skip it entirely."
659,659,"A, magnetic field of the sun harvesting, DIAMAGNETIC LEVITATING space craft that can reach LIGHT speed.... As the magnetic field is light️ and the field travels at the speed of light......... a carbon space craft, that need electrons, paired electrons, to continunesly be pumped into it to keep the diamagnetic force going....   where you land will be a mystery."
660,660,"Giving AI an interface to interact DIRECTLY with the real world, and make it more available than human beings on earth, will be our end."
661,661,affordable robot assistants in 10 years? sci fi movies are becoming reality fast
662,662,"WHAT ABOUT CAPTURING SOLAR ENERGY OUT IN SPACE LIKE THE SHIELD OF THE NEW TELESCOPE, I DONT KNOW ALOT BUT ID IMAGINE YOUD GET A HIGHER ENERGY RATE AND SHUTTLE IT IN BATTERIES DOWN TO EARTH, ALSO MAKE MANUFACTURING IN SPACE OR ON THE MOON AND SHUTTLE FINISHED PIECES BACK HOME."
663,663,"I am positive too, about the future. I need to go to GIGA factory, Austin, Texas."
664,664,Pure inspiration. Pure motivation. This is a breath of pure and fresh air.
665,665,Near the end homeboy tellin him how to better structure his businesses lol
666,666,"All the locals hide their tears of regret
Open fire 'cause I love you to death
Sky high, with a heartache of stone
You'll never see me 'cause I'm always alone"
667,667,": who's city is it?
:it's the people of mars' city.

that's epic"
668,668,"So in the robots database would contain sensitive information of the ""owner"" then that sensitive information goes to cloud? to company? Then ? There are spots for Exploit chance"
669,669,"""If you list my sins I sound like the worst person ever but if you put them against, umm, err, you know, the things I've done right It's not so bad."" - Said like the worst person on Earth"
670,670,"Thank you so very much Mr Anderson , absolutely amazing interview️️️
Very few things have given me the goosebump level of awe this interview has given me. The truth, the vision , the depth of your knowledge on the subjects, your understanding of how Mr Musk is being treated is so unreal, it feels like you have a Neuralink level bandwidth of information and understanding"
671,671,that like made me cry he is working so hard to make a better future for people who have nothing but criticism for him.... Kind of sad
672,672,I am afradi that Elon does too many interviews so that he does not get enough time for work!
673,673,Imagine how different this interview would be if it was CNNs infamous talking egg asking the questions. 
674,674,"If it were anyone else saying all this, I'd say it was complete fantasy. 

But because its Elon I totally believe everything he says"
675,675,the real question is when will there be electric planes ?
676,676,I got so emotional at tge very end. I am tearing up for real. I hope we emulate Elon Musk in a very positive way. Thank you Elon for all that you do. I love you to the moon. 
677,677,What about all the pollution produced by mining the resources needed to make batteries? There as to be enormous innovation in solar to make a significant contribution to our energy needs. We make just as much or more pollution charging current electric vehicles.
678,678,Elon's last sentence is something I truly hope the younger generation take heed.
679,679,"Desalination of seawater could save so many lives and replace the plastic-bottled waters.
Best water to drink is Mineral Water in glass bottles."
680,680,"""people of Mars"" ... ""people of Mars"" ... ""people of Mars"" ... you know they're both trying to avoid saying ""Martians"""
681,681,changes. Only if those 6 are combined will we have a fighting chance of reaching net zero.
682,682,"""Things will be good"".... BUT NOT FOR THE OIL BARONS
which is why things go this way"
683,683,Excellent & inspirational interview.  An optimist view of the future & one I can support. This is why I heavily invest in companies doing the research to make these Scientific aspirations a reality. Even failed experiments are worth the effort we gain knowledge from every effort. Well done.
684,684,"Elon Musk is the only person i look up to, But i disagree with his views on civilization collapse, we need to reduce our population drastically, so that we consume less natural resources, Give Our planet some time to cool off, whilst automations takes up and does all the manual labour. Most importantly we need to make sure that the people that do occupy earth are highly educated, sound minded ( pop must not Comprise mainly nations like North Korea or Iran, Iraq were humans do not contribute and are oprresed), there must be complete harmony."
685,685,"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
686,686,"Let's Apple do the entertainment for car, Tesla for engine. The Hybridge vehicles will fly."
687,687,Reversing C02 ppm?  How much CO2 ppm do we need to have in the atmosphere to support all plant life we presently have?
688,688,To think there are people who want to take money from this man and give it to the government XD
689,689,The amount of knowledge in his brain was just mind-blowing 
690,690,The future has no place for trillionaires. Temper your expectations Musky-boy 
691,691,How much (physical) time does Elon spend with his seven kids?
692,692,"Haters stop hating .
ELON MUSK IS AMAZING."
693,693,"Big Chief Biden totally ignores the achievements of this wonderful human being. In history books, this will be the only thing Big Chief will be remembered of."
694,694,There's better technology than solar and wind.
695,695,This has to be the best interview of Elon. And much to the credit of the interviewer for asking great questions and being educated on Elon's endeavours.
696,696,Mr. Musk is so much a better of a billionair then any other
697,697,"Amazing interview ! Great questions, great answers"
698,698,"SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide}

and   sooo cool...great  talks..!!!"
699,699,"Musk is such a brilliant forward thinker. I have the utmost respect for him! So my prayer is, can we please have another 10 million men like Musk?"
700,700,"2050? I doubt we we exist, at least in a way that we today can recognize."
701,701,"I personally don't agree with the term ""prediction""; sounds like all they are doing is based on guessing.  Mr. Musk is projecting, which is part of proper planning. Of course you have ups and downs and you also have that into account when planning but they're being pioneers in what they're doing, there's no data on timelines to solve every single new problem they face. Media pointing out flaws on his timelines are useless and boring to read. "
702,702,"We can’t even take care of Earth, a tremendous gift from God, and we want to live on Mars?"
703,703,"Wow… a great great interview.

We need just a LITTLE of his thoughts and interest to change the world people. We can do it! We can have a better future! "
704,704,Wow Ted allowing liberal enemys to speak on their platform what a miracle.
705,705,"Let's build a great present first, us lowly plebs atleast. Let the visionaries worry about mars. How is your relationship with yourself? Your family? These are the questions WE the people should be asking

A pyramid is stable when every piece is stable"
706,706,He's working hard to expand humanity to our whole solar system and on the other side of the world they send rockets to hospitals in a fight over some sowjet weapon industries and a fucking harbor on a peninsula.
707,707,"How about doing some research on green energy being not that green? Mining and processing minerals required for solar panels for example is a very polluting process. We instead need to invest in atomic energy -- making it as safe as possible, making waste disposal compact and safe, and making waste reusable."
708,708,"""Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is..."""
709,709,"This man talks in details with all terminologies related to engineering, AI, space technology and biology. I haven't seen any businessman talking in so much details covering such a wide variety of disciplines.
Thanks to Chris Anderson for such a structured interview."
710,710,And he just said he hopes it won't murder us in our sleep. Yes.
711,711,"How long will it be until we see headlines that say things like, ""Man commits Optimus assisted suicide,"" or, ""Optimus robot commanded to bugle neighbors' homes.""?"
712,712,"Population collapse ? WTH ️. I am his greatest fan, but don’t subscribe to that notion. We have barely been able to manage population explosion currently."
713,713,"Be great to put some funds in helping the child trafficking exposure as well Elon, with so much to offer to help free the children."
714,714,The shortage of Labor is only because people do not want to work thanks to our government.
715,715,Elon gives me hope for a better future. Hopefully we don’t run out of time before it’s able to happen
716,716,If people only understood the dirty processes that go into making those batteries and producing all that electricity that we require to charge them with they would realize all of the inadequate alternatives are no better and could arguably be worse.
717,717,One of the greatest Interviews of all time! Thanks a lot!
718,718,Every day we get closer and closer to the Omnic Crisis
719,719,It's nice to hear someone talk positive about the future.
720,720,"""Next year""  -Elon Musk 2004-2022"
721,721,Thank god for this dude. Taking humanity to Mars while also trying to ensure free speech on public platforms. What a guy.
722,722,"Elon look into something called ""reflective memory""...."
723,723,"The last 10 minutes of the interview is what most outstanding about everything - Elon himself and his mission on Earth. Thank you Mr. Anderson for your genuine lead of this interview. 
It hits me so hard with the last bit of Elon's saying ""Take action to make it (our future) good."""
724,724,"1. batteries are not the only way to store power, mechanical will also be important. 2, why do we want self-driving cars? I love driving, I dislike being driven. 3. who wants robots to tidy up or take tea to grandma? these are the things that make us human. If we are not doing this, then what will we be doing? 4. ""a place where it is harder to create laws than it is to get rid of them"" 5. the meaning of life is to participate in the cycle, not to control it. 6 ""we need to secure the future of consciousness by becoming a multiplanetary sepcies"" denies the consciousness of other forms of life. 7: the primary existential risk facing consciousness is the destruction of the atmosphere. What affect will a thousand hundred ton missions to mars a year have on the atmosphere?"
725,725,So enjoy any interview of Elon... the depth to his thought is astonishing.
726,726,this interviewer guy seems like he has .1% elon in him.
727,727,Is it just me or is the gentleman interviewing Elon musk dying to own a robot for sexual pleasure over the other millions of reasons that one might find robots to be useful for. I’m just saying that he was a little too excited by the possibility. I found it interesting that the thing that gave Elon pause about a home robot was it playing catch with our children. I truly hope that my grandchildren are playing catch with there father’s not robots. It makes me quite sad to imagine the children of our children playing catch with a robot robot
728,728,"I really admire Elon Musk. I think he is the undisputed man of the decade tbh.... however, around 46:00 he says ""...lets say 100,000 USD... I think anyone can work and save up...""
... ...... ............
This dude is so F$%^ING rich he has lost all sight of the lower end of economics. I mean, in the US, this is kind of, maybe, true? As in, if you got a decent job and literally lived your life entirely for this goal, eating as cheaply as you can and not wasting a penny.... then i guess this is true? However... if you were to try to live a decent normal life at the same time, saving up that kind of money in a timely manner simply isnt viable for the majority."
729,729,Despite the hate on Elon I need to say that he is a brilliant man and I’m excited to see what he is bringing to this crazy world. 
730,730,Elon is so far ahead of everyone with his future projects and thoughts that I couldn’t be prouder That he is in our world. He only makes it a better place for everyone!
731,731,Elon recently had a child with the entertainer “Grimes” who is now in a relationship with a man/woman. It is common knowledge his child will have the future freedom to choose his own sexuality.
732,732,"when exactly was this interview recorded?
can't believe it was in April `22.
nothing about Ukraine!
nothing about the German Giga Factory!"
733,733,"Elon says something in the beginning that showed me how my opinion on him has changed. I once was excited about many of the things he does, but now he represents something that makes me afraid that the future will be horrible. He's becoming a standard member of the super rich class. He fights union efforts at his companies, he does things because he can without asking if he should, and he has the power to make the future a techno-capitalist hellscape. I really hope he doesn't."
734,734,I dont want a world where everything is tech..
735,735,Good interview. I love the way he promotes the future of A.I. while still being cautious which is reasonable. A made man would want to create with no regard for the consequences.  The interviewer also asked good questions.  The future is !
736,736,"Funny, he completely ignores hydrogen as a renewable energy! Just check out the leaps forward by companies like Sun-Hydrogen"
737,737,"I think for the most part Ellon has his heart in the right place, but still, it's sad that most people still consider ""technological evolution = betterment of humanity"". We can evolve our gadgets all we want, if we don't evolve in terms of VALUES, empathy, peace, cooperation, etc..........we aren't going to have a future worth getting excited about."
738,738,He has a very strong vision as well as a perspective to support his vision.
739,739,"'We're in this vast darkness of space, and there's this little candle of consciousness, that's only come about after 4.5 billion years.' 

Wow."
740,740,"We Are Human 
We Don't Need No Robots"
741,741,This interview makes me want to meet him .   But I would love to hear his personal story. And what he likes to do besides business. And this older lady would love one of those robots! A country robot!  haha
742,742,"musk have calculated that world needs 300 twh of batteries. 

World uses 160000 twh of energy each year. That 0.2 % world world energy demand?"
743,743,"One of the most interesting interviews, really gets you thinking and being excited for the future, while also wishing you could live longer to see how far us humans will go"
744,744,"Keeping on top of 3 revolutionary tasks  (for lack of better words) and still be sane, humble, and respectful is almost impossible to comprehend "
745,745,"He asks exactly those questions, I'd want to ask. Very satisfying haha, great interview "
746,746,"""Go to Mars - it's dangerous, camped, difficult, and hard work - you might not make it back!""
 I'LL GO"
747,747,I would love if interviewers brought up Asteroid mining or large space stations and pick Elons brain on those
748,748,Famous last words. He will have to eat all the things he said this year
749,749,"This morning seeing this for the first time I was so consumed by experiencing this brilliant human being that I wasnt quite aware of his words. Seeing this video again tonight is a whole new experience. Elon, I adore you. You are real and honest."
750,750,this man is an inspiration for everyone on this earth.
751,751,"Personally, this video is very emotional/inspiring rather informative."
752,752,Amazing
753,753,"What a nice conversation, and also good that Elon took his time to set the intention of this conversation to not be a exact future prediction."
754,754,"Things aren't as they seem. Energy can be produced in so many ways, Algae, magnets, place some rods in there hey ""Skies the Limit"" matter fact a superconducting metal can be suspended within the stratosphere indefinitely providing a source of infinite power."
755,755,"How not to support him? He´s already helped more people than we can even count, I think the world is a better place thanks to this man. ""If you want the future to be good, you must make it so, take action to make it good"". Great interview!"
756,756,love this interview. Chris is explaininng difficult concepts in easy words so everyone can imagine what it is.
757,757,One of the best Elon Musk interviews ever. The interviewer asked great pointed questions. He definitely did all his homework.
758,758,"Elon being driven around by the self driving tech in his cars - he must feel like he's being driven around by one of his children. Probably a level of scrutiny, but also pride and fulfillment. Must be nice!"
759,759,24:36 one of the things to look forward in the future.
760,760,"Elon should buy the amazon rainforest, 1 to protect it from Brazil goverment selling it off to loggers and miners and 2 it would p*** of Jeff Bezos since Elon would technically own Amazon."
761,761,"""I don't want to blow your mind, but I'm not always right"" hah, I love that lol"
762,762,He started Paypal in South Africa. Now he thinks about the entire world.
763,763,"Musk is so genuine. No hidden agendas - at least, that I can see. He's not ""selling"" anything. He just solves BIG problems - and deserves every penny he's made."
764,764,His discussion of philanthropy was epically insightful
765,765,Ignore the haters Elon...You are such an Highly Inspiring Individual...soldier on with all the amazing breakthroughs !!!...
766,766,"Mr Musk. If you want to help, why not make an affordable electric car?
This may come as a shock to you but over 50% of  Americans make 30K or less a year.
How can one afford one of your cars when that is all one makes??? Hmmmmmmmmm???
If can Dacia make an Elecrtric car for like $16 why can't Tesla?"
767,767,THANKYOU Elon for speaking positive side of our lives in the future. We are on a GOOD path as long as not complacent. THANKYOU! WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE and think positive. Why is it that we want to eliminate gasoline vehicles and ignore how much PLASTICS are polluting our earth and oceans???
768,768,Has anybody in the world calculated the exact amount of all the pollution all the emissions from burning fossil fuels all the carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels all the inner gases all the water vapor everything that's pollutes the air has anyone calculated exactly what percentage that consists of of the entire Earth atmosphere has anyone done that yet tell me please.... On second thought you know this is a trick question and you know I know don't you and I'll venture to say I'll bet my net worth against Elon Musk that's the answer I'm going to give you right now is 100% accurate... And isn't friendly wages on such things the custom that's been going on for a hundreds of years like I have a couple of wealthy friends who have a million dollar bet against who's Ford F-150 will fail first and I think they're starting out with let's see it must have been I can't hardly remember now it's over 20 years 1980s or something almost 50 years now one of them got like too many miles on it and catching up with a minute and a half if you look at what the steel is made out of the trucks use and the bodies and everything and all the all the parts then turn off engine parts 18 wheelers that's all we have on this planet we don't have any magic and it's not uncommon for an 18-wheeler to have a million miles on it in less than 10 years because we would let most of our freight trains and what one freight train can haul from Chicago to LA now takes 400 18 wheelers to do the same job....
769,769,Elon is AI in human flesh! What a genius. …and kudos to the interviewer. Simply brilliant!
770,770,Musk gives me hope for our future
771,771,Split second scenario interventions is amazing. To be able to run a scenario within nano seconds amazing.
772,772,"every thing will die with time, change is permanent"
773,773,"Tesla would never have messed with solar and wind.
Energy is infinite.
I hope Elon can fix twitter -
maybe then we can learn about zero point gravity."
774,774,I am agreed  with Elon but Tesla cards are very pensive how are we going to afford it?
775,775,I wish I could be part of the forum with Elon making our future better for everyone !!! He is so sweet and has so many great ideas.
776,776,"dude. This might be a sneak peek into the future. this is mind blowing. 
AI-Human symbiosis sounds so exciting."
777,777,"Such a honest, decent human being for being one of the richest  most influential men in all of history. Fascinating guy. Great that he's standing up for free speech too"
778,778,"First real use: military
Second real use: citizen medical
Third: transportation
Fourth: video games"
779,779,Que entrevista monumental! 
780,780, in order to avoid a natural event climate  catastrophe aka Mother Nature doing we must go into a sustainable energy economy.
781,781,"Yeah, there are agencies out there that would not let their robots have protective measures. They will use the robots to damage people. There's a rule: If it can be done, it's being done. Legality and rules are not a consideration."
782,782,"..nuclear..nuclear..nuclear energy Elon, on earth ..esp as well as in space.."
783,783,Love how to changes the Economic rules of the game in every challenge he takes on.
784,784,"""every high quality minute of thinking is a million dollars""  First off, if Elon was some greedy CEO like so many people try to frame him as, he wouldn't be giving a 60 min interview for less than 60 millions dollars. The fact that he's doing it for free, is pretty nice of him. How many other CEOs would give up 60 million to share information with us? And, let's think about that in terms of production capability... the most I've ever been able to produce, thus far, is 3 dollars per minute. Someone working a $20/hour job is producing .33 dollars per minute. That's means my minute is worth 9 times much as their minute in terms of producing or accomplishing a task. And that means Elon's minute is worth 333,333 times as much as mine. Now, I don't believe these are absolute indicators of a person's worth BY ANY MEANS. People have value in many different ways beyond money output or production capability. BUT, this output capacity is directly related to our states of consciousness none the less. The more aware and consciousness we are, the greater our output is. My point, is that even though we all have lots of potential, many of us are squandering it. Compared to Elon, I'm a complete fool. And compared to me, that 20 dollar an hour person is a fool too. This illustrates how large of a dynamic spectrum we can occupy in our states of consciousness. I don't think we should feel bad about not super achieving, but I do think we should ask ourselves if we are selling ourselves short. If you asked me if that 20/hr person has value, I would say ""of they course do, and their value is WAY higher than they think it is"". I have sold myself short many times. So many of us have. Let's try to not do that anymore. Let's search for our TRUE potential, not the potential/labels we have put on ourselves, or the ones society has thrown on us."
785,785,"solar, wind and even nuclear power must be stored, need batteries and hydro storage reservoirs - I am glad Elon Musk is emphasizing this, STORAGE infrastructure is key ....."
786,786,"So much anxiety and stuttering from Elon, why listen to this guy for his views...pro nuclear..wow, why is it they had free energy a thousand years ago..enough to power cities..as much as ever needed...oh yes...control and money"
787,787,"Superb interview, Juliet & Chris!"
788,788,Extreme climate change will end life on Earth but not an issue on Mars 
789,789,"""If you want the future to be good, then make it so. Take action, and it'll be good"" Elon Musk 2022"
790,790,"Elon should define what cheap mean. Corporate greed is a thing. I like the man, but some of the stuff is too idealistic and may not be achievable in his timeline, but I still wish him the best."
791,791,"How does Musk reconcile his optimistic view of the future with what seems to be a prevailing Malthusian viewpoint from the mainstream, especially within elite circles?"
792,792,"48:01 but then the oil companies fight back, and they bloody win."
793,793,I vote Elon to be Earth's spokesperson
794,794,"The climate always changes. Our impact on it is miniscule, will they recant their statements 100 years from now when all their tinkering plunges us into an ice age? Which is more preferable; warmer weather or colder weather?"
795,795,He's pro nuclear power generation because he's a brilliant man. He's pro wind and solar because he's also a business man.
796,796,Elon brings hope!
797,797,Elon is a very inspiring person. Thank you for your work for the future of humanity!
798,798,"Great conversation both men seem to have immense mutual respect . And excellent questions, Equally well answered"
799,799,"If you are willing to work 24/7 - not take vacations and have every fiber of your being wrapped up in your work, then you can talk about his wealth."
800,800,"""We should call Earth 'Water'."""
801,801,"Out of interest, would Graphene batteries serve of some use or are they currently harder to manufacture?"
802,802,24:35 he remembers his promise UwU
803,803,"Great interview! What amazes me is that he doesn't seem to need any prescription glasses! Does he need reading glasses. His eyes might have gone through some of the most brutal abuse among all of us, imagine the countless hours behind screens since he was a kid, the stress and lack of sleep. Kudos to Elon's eyes!"
804,804,"Softball interview. Throw Elon some tough questions like: Why do you think 75,000 species a year are going extinct....vs  the normal rate of 8 per year? Electric robot taxis are projected to double global passenger miles over the next 8 years. Do you think a 40% efficiency increase while doubling the usage will decrease emissions? I could go on and on. Techno optimism is likely a mirage. We are in big trouble."
805,805,We can never have too many interviews of this legend!
806,806,"The interviewer reminds me of an academic version of Ricky Gervais, right?"
807,807,"Of the two richest men in the world..only Elon, will be remembered."
808,808,He is perfekt
809,809,Thank you Chris and Elon for this interview!
810,810,"These guys should conduct the next Presidential election to see if the next leader is going to be forward thinking.

Rules: No speaking for others."
811,811,"Intuitively, I thought the declining birthrate would be a good thing. We constantly hear about overpopulation, not underpopulation. One could be forgiven for thinking that the climate crisis could be averted simply by reducing our numbers, net consumption, and energy needs. Now I'm curious why Elon believes our current birthrate is insufficient to sustain our human civilization. I guess it's time to re-examine my current beliefs with a critical eye in light of new information."
812,812,He seems so smart yet unaware of more efficient solutions. It doesn't make sense to retrofit a 150 year old technology. If you're going to build an automated transportation system build a completely new system. As soon as your conveyance is hanging from a track above the road. Automation will be simple with nothing more than well  established technology.  Such a system would also be more energy efficient. 
813,813,THE MOMENT IN TIME ! 
814,814,People need to realize musk did not invent or create Tesla or the electric car. He simply invested his money in stock that he earned through selling of PayPal. We all know how crappy a product that is.
815,815,Excellent interview. Comparing him to other billionaires is lunacy.
816,816,"08:00 - Sea water isn't unlimitted though? Couldn't using that lower sealevels? 

I think using the oceans current to generate power would be a good idea though."
817,817,How smart is this guy? A blessing to humanity!
818,818,A class act. And a modern pioneer who will be remembered for centuries.
819,819,"Great start! The 1st question is more of a statement than a question about the 'climate apocalypse' end-times. Elon fires back,""I'm not one of those doomsday people."" That answer convinced me to watch the rest of this great interview."
820,820,"On top of the list, satanic minions cleaner robots! Great intervieuw, hope Elon proves to be a humanist first."
821,821,"57:37 yeah we know how supporting works 1:00:07 they were billing him because he knew about the laws like they were doing to other people so it's really messed up obviously we don't believe he was alone there 1:0:01:04 keep the things you love in our areas always sharing like we're famous everyone will consider themselves more fully. 1:05:10 that's what my new pants are for since ""I'm buyin' ️? Those guys huh Elon?  know we were teasing SO YOU ILL KNOW WHAT NOT TO DO; that wasn't going to work either. Exactly. Keep up they great work and if you need cheered up I'm always here. "
822,822,Y did that feel like a conversation with a higher being? Damn..
823,823,The respect for Elon Musk keeps growing everyday. It is very important for next generation to take Elon work as inspiration and make humanity and this planet a better place for everyone.
824,824,"Tesla should take their car to crowded city like Mumbai and then test their software. They will have their labelling finished in one day. 
The real AI can only be achieved when it works in Mumbai."
825,825,"Perovskite solar and efficient fusion reactors is the dream, I hope we get there in my lifetime as that’s the turning point of humanity and earth. That’s the point at which energy production will exceed demand and it will all be clean. With the production of solid state batteries too it’s just, an incredible future to look forward to."
826,826,News Flash: Having lots of batteries all over the world doesn't equate to sustainability.  He's delusional.
827,827,I think Stephen Hawking was far more intelligent and helpful then Elon or Mr. Anderson. He did more for science then these two will ever do because money was not his wish not even on his radar by far. Compare Hawkings achievements awards to Elon and you will easily see.
828,828,Wish Steve Jobs was still us us... Two world shakers
829,829,This man is inspiring. He is creating and innovating… very exciting. Thank you Elon for contributing to the world and making things better
830,830,"The idea of a vehicle that drives itself but still needs safety features is counter productive. I think most people understand this and still buy AI powered cars as a support for the development for AI. True self driving cars will happen when every single vehicle on the road is driven by the same system. Current cities have roads that evolved from the carriage. We need cities that are, from the very beginning, built with the intent of supporting an entire system of automated transportation pods. Cities that from the beginning don't have stop signs or traffic lights. These pods will not even need safety features because they will all be operated by the same neural net. This neural net will be possible, and is dependent, on the development of computing power and connection speeds. All of this is already known by many but it's not worth breaking your head about it because all of this is not possible yet with current technology. It is also dependent on the desire of the consumers and public opinion. Who will want to live like this? Public persuasion goes hand in hand with the advancement of technology. In both of these aspects, humanity isn't there yet. Once humanity wants, and is able to, build a city, or modify an existing one, it will be because there are already millions lined up with the desire to live this way and willing to purchase a home in a city such as this. In this economy people won't actually own their vehicle anymore but whatever. I'd rather skip this part and go straight to drone transportation but maybe a middle step is needed in order for consumers to completely trust the neural network."
831,831,How do you not want to root for Elon
832,832,"The bot tidys, mows, mops, cleans and with uv lights sterilizes, has a CO detector, fire detector, records security video audio, folds laundry."
833,833,"IDK, man. He never experienced poverty and will never understand it. People see him as a hero. As for me, I see him as opportunist. He knew (or guessed) what people will need in the future and make more money from that and he can control of most useful facilities, thus, granting him more power and authority. Business as usual."
834,834,"2000 - no phones, no internet/
2022 - phones / internet / crypto lol
2050 - CAN U IMAGINE ?"
835,835,How great it is to be alive and inspired by Elon Musk in my life time.  He's one of those rare humans that history will study and talk about his greatness long after we are gone.
836,836,"The concern is the INFLUENCE the rich ""consume"" in the world, which ends up disproportionately and unfairly advancing their self interests and to the detriment of the masses."
837,837,"Elon Musk: If you want the future to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good, and it will be."
838,838,"He’s running his cars as a web3 appliances.

Interesting."
839,839,Think about the reality of goodness than the perception of goodness 
840,840,humanity unifiedly needs to develop a asteroid suppression system. planetary version of the iron dome in Israel!!
841,841,can you imagine if nikola tesla were here today and was able to speak with elon musk what those two could come up with >>>>> would be incredible.
842,842,בטסלה יהיו משקפיים עם מערכת הפעלה כמו בחזרה לעתיד 2 עם מערכת הפעלהבAR Tesla Googles לעבודה מזכוכית או מתכת בלי מסך באמצע. במאי גאון המציא אפילו נעליים שנשרכות לבד. היה יכול להיות מולטי מיליארדר. והמציא את הAR.
843,843,SO SO SO grateful for this man. Such a beautiful light in what is often a dark world. Absolute legend.
844,844,"yees, we need more people to sustain the aging population, elon included. Elon is deeply involved with WEF. Be aware of this fact."
845,845,Elon would have been one of the next POTUSes if it weren't for his country of birth.
846,846,"What is future for a 100 year old ?
Only if several humans make it till there"
847,847,Elon will be the biggest arms dealer on planet Earth.  How wonderful.
848,848,thank you!
849,849,I had no idea what he was all about until very recently. Thank you for this!
850,850,As a scientist and engineer: we love solving real world problems!
851,851,"The Future Worth Excitement For Evolution ! All the Best , Daniela Zori !"
852,852,I'm thinking about a few pollution vacuums huge ones attached to them satellites. Lol
853,853,"Until Nikola Tesla`s technology is not gonna be released into public we cant stop using fossils... 

""Electric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities and can drive the world's machinery without the need of coal, oil, gas, or any other of the common fuels. We are whirling through endless space with an inconceivable speed, all around us everything is spinning, everything is moving, everywhere is energy."" Nikola Tesla"
854,854,"Its not. Shortage of labour its a laziness crisis
Its the fact u need a degree for everything"
855,855,Chris Anderson has to be the best interviewer i have ever witnessed . He really is great and this was a great interview all round.
856,856,It is hard to be a true individual in the modern world. And it must be terribly lonely.
857,857,"An amazing interview with such a powerful closing remark: if you want the future to be good, then you must make it so.

It’s a great guiding principle. Not every day will it feel possible, but we must take responsibility to make the most positive difference we can with our own individual resources."
858,858,"Great perspective on everything. Agree on the collapse of humanity - not overpopulation. I did the math a few years back: Take the rather moderate population density of Munich and spread it to the US. It would hold roughly 15 Billion People and the rest of the entire planet which has a landmass multiple times the US would be our garden EDEN. Now move to the density of Tokyo, the surface area of the US  could hold 30 Billion people and still have the rest be our farmland and fruit garden."
859,859,1:02:00 is the hardest I have laughed in so fucking long
860,860,"Musk starting to talk a little like William F. Buckley, Jr."
861,861,Russia's new ICBM would have been impressive if it could return to pad after delivering the payload.. there ICBM looks lot like there old ICBM
862,862,If we can make another exoplanet earth we can make earth stay earth
863,863,The conduction of this interview is superb. Love the way the questions were directed.
864,864,Back on earth life really is getting better.
865,865,Damn this guy has a soothing voice
866,866,Thats why they say there are a lot of trials and errors before success.
867,867,"It is not the critic who counts; not the person who points out how the strong person stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends oneself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that one's place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. -Teddy Roosevelt"
868,868,Nikola Tesla invented it before :D
869,869,"I aspire to be as great of an interviewer as this. Thank you, and thank Elon, for everything."
870,870,"Please create your own twitter-YouTube company.  It should be cheaper and better.  Thank you Elon.  You are an inspiration to us all!
Consider allowing us to show our support by donating 5$ or more to your endeavor.  A way for us to vote in support."
871,871,Very well done!! This brilliant lecture is proof when two intelligent people come in one room.
872,872,I dont know how we will convince people to PAY to go to mars when we cant even get people to have babies?
873,873,Tesla’s unfair media coverage is due to is lack of advertising with legacy media. Zoom out a bit to understand.
874,874,"''Elon Said this would happen, and it didn't happen, he is a lair and a fool'' hahahahhaha 6:18"
875,875,Honestly so excited for tesla bot. Nothing like 'the future is here' when there is an automaton helping you around the house.
876,876,"No one has only good need reported about them. Fact of the matter is, Elon is changing the world."

880,880,Just like many companies Tesla is limited to the manufacture of items that they have marketed to them. the future will bring new batteries which will charge in seconds check out structural batteries.
881,881,"Thank you for keeping it real. Love your content, all of it. nice T.a. video, we will go into a recession cuz of the war and supply chains issues, the macro economics are too grrrey and going black.More emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than hodling.  Crypto will make more people financially independent than any other asset class in history  .. Expect Gerry Schmidt also has been doing an excellent job evaluating all charts, trades on BTC, which has helped my portfolio grow to 12.7 BTC."
882,882,"Why doesn't he say the truth about the real purpose of Neuralink. 

Recreating the ""Kingsmen"" scene."

884,884,"I love the idea of increasing the birth rate, but who is going to take care of my other child for me? Wish we had a nanny! LOL"
885,885,We can build a beautiful  better future  ..but we need CARBON  for a green flourishing  planet ..think Elon think 
886,886,...2040 / 2050 THIS WILL BE SOOOO OUT OF DATED - PERPETUAL ENERGY WILL HAVE TAKEN OVER 100%...
887,887,"Hey Elon, how far away does your spaceship need to be when the sun explodes? Because someone here did not receive what they were supposed to receive. And now the aliens won't help you. You're on your own Amun and amen."
888,888,Starship is  great but i am 100% sure NASA will never allow them to land that think how they want to with humanes inside it i am 60% sure they wont even allow starting with humans becouse there is no escape plan / pot
889,889,"Interview timeline



*The future 00:30

*Avoiding climate catastrophy 01:20"
890,890,Perspective analogy through video focusing  with audio editing and feed  back auto  loaders  are memory demanding  for any ram on or in any machine or device .? very Intriguing!
891,891,"We, humanity, love you too Elon! You are the world greatest philanthropist and yet you are mistakenly portrayed as a capitalist. Don’t ever give up hope or stop. We need you more than any single human on earth!"
892,892,How about making ai for flying cars?  The ai problem becomes a lot easer... and we get flying cars.
893,893,"Ah yes, the well known local maxima of the logarithm."
894,894,Why can't he fly on his won rocket like Jeff Bezos and Richard Charles?
895,895,"Elon Musk is one the greatest minds of all times. 

It's great to be alive during ""Elon Time""."
896,896,why doesn't he talk about zero point energies and other alt energy that will be around
897,897,Chris Anderson is phenomenal.
898,898,Elon Musk in using his status and influence to shape our expectations of the future in his favour so that he can profit from it️ I’m not so sure how cool that is️ Maybe converting the worlds fleet transport to battery powered cars is not such a great idea. Is there a better way
899,899,"Wow, can't even imagine the horrific world where everyone starts having 7 kids.  There won't be a forest or open field anywhere.  Wish he had given some justification so that it could be picked apart with facts."
900,900,"re: the ""why do it"" question, I think there's only one reasonable answer.....In a prominent sci-fi film, an android (David), asks a scientist what he would give to know why man was created...the scientist (Holloway) says, ""anything""...David smiles and asks ""why did you create me?""...Holloway takes the cue ball he's playing with and banks it around the bumpers of the pool table, and says ""because we could""...David replies, ""would it upset you to know that's why you were created?""...."
901,901,"Elon, why not more Hydro Water energy. Rivers flow continuously, the oceans waves are constant."
902,902,"just listen closely  to elon words . yes tesla progress and humanity has hurt his mind and heart. but when asked does ge believe in God , he choked looked away and gave a clearly bla answer . done ."
903,903,One of the best interviews out there!
904,904,"I know that one may no longer be critical... Luckily I do not have to be political correct. Interesting interview, yet I see Mr. Musk preaching for his own interest. Musk is an excellent business man, please remember he did not start Tesla, to name just one thing. And with a bit of misfortune the climate issue will be solved by a nuclear war and the subsequent nuclear winter... Problem solved."
905,905,Lost count of the amount of times musk said uh in the 60s 
906,906,"Mumbai is in India - FYI

And thank you for this video."
907,907,Elon needs to speak to BrainChip about Akida.
908,908,Brilliant
909,909,"Love just hearing someone say the future is bright! We got this world, keep your head up! Even in a pool of tears, ones reflection is facing the sky. Keep your head up."
910,910,Have to try to build triplicated fail safes into the process.
911,911,"Such an interesting man to listen to. With the exploration of the brain, I would love to see someone with Elon’s brilliance & financial capabilities research epilepsy. So many people suffer with their only hopes that medication will provide a somewhat decent life. My daughter is one of them. With all that’s been explored with AI it gives me some hope that maybe one day there could be help…but we’ll never know if no one tries"
912,912,Has he solved any problems?
913,913,"I think he is such a positive force, we need more of him in today's world."
914,914,"Amazing interview! 
Take action! make good!"
915,915,"Hopefully amongst the people in the comments, and those watching this video, we'll have other individuals ready and willing to build towards a better future for themselves and others. Don't leave Elon to have all the fun lol."
916,916,"I think $100,000 is cheaper than incarceration costs.  Sounds like Australia all over again"
917,917,"So good to hear Elon talk about labelling , few years back I was a part of the labelling team for Mercedes/BMW ,honestly it not an easy task."
918,918,"Abstractly, Elon is striving to eliminate scarcity.  Scarcity is root of all problems to humanity.  There are many types of scarcity, and Elon is tackling energy scarcity.  Which, requires AI and when that is reality can then be used to tackle other scarcities like food scarcity, transportation scarcity, housing scarcity, and so on.  When we eliminate all forms of scarcity, then we eliminate the need for economics.  In a world of abundance, there would be no need for money/trade - everything is available freely.  Economics is truly the root of all evils."
919,919,"What drives him is knowing the helmsman are not headed to the sunrise/sunset. Thier eyes are on the whirlpool. 
Would've loved if he said ""Do Something"" Step up don't tweet. Unless Elon can drive that Bark properly as well!"
920,920,"11:00 closed off self driving cars from LA to NY... What a dumb idea. Have you heard of trains? Electric for years, can transport thousands of people at once...."
921,921,"Esta pieza maestra necesita subtitulos en todos los idiomas, por favor!!!!!!!"
922,922,so what happens when the sun get solar eruption big enough to hit earth a massive emp charge and what happend that day when everything is running on electricity then we will not be very vulnerable?  a new way of waging war on big emp bombs. and can AI solve the war problem once and for all.
923,923,"Chris is such a great interviewer, thank you!"
924,924,The greatest human that has ever walked the earth - and in our life time! Shame on the SEC and anyone troubling him along the way. Everything he does massively benefits humanity.
925,925,"Believe in the good work towards the good, thy will be done and our will is beautiful and full of life."
926,926,Object permanence! I haven't heard anyone say it yet.
927,927,"Every financial goal requires patience, dedication and consistent spirit knowing that investment is currently the most lucrative business in the world, both NFT, real estate and Crypto shares are really positively changing people's lives."
928,928,dude in our world people cant save up even 10k usd lol
929,929,This  gentleman is inspirational .
930,930,Elon is turning into a full fledged American.  Benjamin Franklin and George Wa
931,931,"The danger is that humans would be depleted mentally and physically with a robot doing everything for us. We become weak by not using our arms and hand to do basic tasks in our home. Become lazier as the year goes by, and natural physical strength will diminish. We would have killed ourselves for the sake of progress."
932,932,"Tesla, Tesla Energy, SpaceX, Neuralink, Starlink, Boring...unbelievable."
933,933,"Outstanding, mind blowing and incredibly inspiring discussion.  Elon belongs to the super human league."
934,934,"0:02 ""Elon Musk, how are you?""

Interviewer's wife has left him and has custody of the kids, Dog has died"
935,935,"Elon Musk-
""I will make a robot cat girl"" 
Saving the world one robot at a time"
936,936,Elon Musk's level of mindset and thinking is what makes him great. He figured out almost all major formulas to life's success. How much you can do in a minute'. I was thinking about time the other day and thought: what can I accomplish in a second... or a millisecond.
937,937,"“Take action to make it good, and it will be.” He’s awesome"
938,938,I love this man! So inspiring!
939,939,"Powerful Interview. The generation that will say thank you is not us. Thanks Elon for the closing remark, I take that personal"
940,940,just add B-ECO fuel tabs to the gas and zero emissions
941,941,Thank you Elon for everything you do
942,942,Respect
943,943,What an amazing visionary. I haven’t been this encouraged about our future for as long as I can remember. Thank you so much Elon. Thank you so much.
944,944,the last minutes of this interview amazing to hear how someone is playing huge role in the way how humanity moving forward towards the future 
945,945,"The sheer breadth of topics, rational optimism and futurism in this hour-long interview is mind blowing. Really liked his defense of his wealth and definition of philanthropy from the perspective of his companies."
946,946,"Q:Who does MARS belong to? ....
A: Its  The People of Mars' City (TPM )city

...Then there was a break in silence. It's that moment when you realise you just slipped and said stuff that the everage human is not ready to hear. LoL  @"
947,947,"In a very real way Elon is facilitating the future I was promised when I was a kid, and it'll just be kicking into high gear before (hopefully) I go."
948,948,"future might be bright but chemistry is new science  in STEM , we need better science in classes in elementary schools, not just books be science doing!!"
949,949,"Wonder how many entrepreneurs, geniuses and people who will one day change the world in different areas are now inspired and committed to follow their dreams by seeing Elon make his dream happen, one day they will say they did it because of him"
950,950,"I swear a god. This guy amazes me every day. Literally every time I hear an interview with him he's 100 steps ahead. Damn
Ps: Listening about Neurolink while doing physiotherapy due to cerebral palsy it's really exciting :D"
951,951,Literally... still the most inspiring human in the realms of scientific Entrepreneurship! Humble and value creating even at this level of wealth. Kudos to you Elon for becoming even more true day to day.
952,952,He remembers the promise of the Cat Girls!
953,953,That was amazing.  What am I going to do with myself for the rest of the day?  Too much energy after all that excitement!
954,954,Please subtittles in many languages  ... italian please
955,955,"I loved everything about this interview, We must take Action and become a Multi-Planetary species , We must Save the Earth . We must Strive for Sustainability .️️"
956,956,Masterpieces conversation 
957,957,"This guy is solving the ultimate existential crisis of our time, and still is pestered about his predictions for playing Tetris in your car are off by a year.
Thanks Society."
958,958,"The modern Era of technological advances is not a light to everyone, Elons vision of the future probably makes most people happy, but it would make me sad. I'm saying this here bc no one ever hears me, my dreams, my words fall through the cracks. I'm not articulate enough like some people to explain my side of standpoint, but I know the worst has yet to come, any invention can be good, but man's intentions are most often deplorable."
959,959,"Wow, this really was an amazing interview. It's crazy to think about people that dislike this man. He has already accomplished so much for society as a whole and to add on top of that continues to be motivated on ways to improve upon the whole we love in. Individuals like this should absolutely be rewarded and compensated at the levels he is at. This really does prove if you set your focus business wise on the improvement of society as a whole vs on the best ways to make money it is very likely that you'll be compensated appropriately over the long term. IMO this is the best aspect and advantages of living in a capitalistic society."
960,960,"We are trying to do too many thing in a random environment for self driving, If we are doing in a restrict rules enviroment. It is a lot easier to solve. So put in real world, we need Government coop in regulation for designated driving environment by resticting options."
961,961,how can someone reasonable trust the richest man in the world? That's ridiculous.
962,962,I must have been living under a rock; I thought the left loved Musk?
963,963,Greatest human being on the planet! Save us Elon!
964,964,"Elon, USA need to pass legislation immediately to create the world standards for self driving cars. 

Its crazy that we have been hitting every milestone in technology 20 years ahead intime, we cant afford another 20 years until we convince americans we MUST BUILT NEW ROADS for self driving cars NOW. Please elon. This is what you need to get done. Use your platform that you have now, and promote buiulding highways that is self driving. "
965,965,"@1:03:48 he mentions how depopulation is becoming dissaster globaly. 
Thanks to Almighty God that we Muslims are safe from this increasing problem and that we are helping the world by producing new generation.
Our beloved Prophet advised our men:"
966,966,I’d like to know where Elon had his hair transplant. I’m thinking of having it done turkey
967,967,"Elon is amazing person, we all can do our little bit to help towards this end goal it will make a big difference, we all can be mindful of our actions and decisions"
968,968,"have to disagree about population growth & nuclear.  Look around, too many human is the ultimate cause for so many problems: climate, pollution, wars, genocides, ... etc... Imagine the current world with half of the population. Human is just not mature enough to handle nuclear."

972,972,Thorium Breeders for the win!  Maintain quality of life smartly!
973,973,"Without watching this video, just by looking at Musk's
 facial expression, It doesn't look like he's excited about the future
It looks quite the opposite"
974,974,"It takes Fossil Fuel to create solar panels, Wind Turbines, everything!!!!!!!!"
975,975,"Wow, this was one fantastic interview. It underscores why I think so highly about Elon Musk, who is greatly misunderstood and attacked by idiots who don't have a clue. Elon is one incredible human being, and we are so lucky to have him."
976,976,"Elon doesn't get it.  Driving is made on assumptions not fact.  Assuming traffic in your direction is on the road.  Assuming everybody is driving where YOU can drive too.  Assuming that's a dog, not a cat, a person, not a horse.  Save the deep assumptions for the important, leaving the unimportant as assumptions which may or may not be fact."
977,977,"From the moment that I started driving with FSD, the system as improved leaps and bounds. For fact I can drive in the freeway and not worry, all I have to do is be alert. In the city it works fine but I have to be more alert. I do believe this is the year."
978,978,What an incredible interview!!
979,979,"I am very very interested in Robots, Sustainable Energy, going to space and many more things since childhood. When I see this man, I feel very proud that my thinking is correct . This man inspired me to do something for the future, hopefully I will do something that creates a path for very very exciting future."
980,980,Only certain people should be allowed access to AI.
981,981,"Amazing interview. Elon inspires a new definition of ""Thinking Big"". The bar has been raised. Imagine."
982,982,Elon Musk has alien intelligence
983,983,"“If you want the future to be good, you must make it so.” We must all do our part, one action at a time. See you in the good future."
984,984,"I could listen to Elon everyday all day so intelligent and such a nice character and wisdom along with modesty and nice sounding voice, awesome interview"
985,985,What a great conversation this has been. It's quite a delight watching them talk.
986,986,That color grade mistake at 22:17
987,987,Really good interview well done! Some good questions here.
988,988,no talk about local sustainable food systems. etc etc..   im surprised ..   or reducing energy usage  ...hmmm interesting
989,989,"Best point is ""things will be good"" and given time and effort they will."
990,990,"i think when elon finally passes on, someone is bound to take on his words and ideals to continue the quest he started. true power lies not with the money, but what you do with it."
991,991,I love this man; he's a living ledge! 
992,992,And when all the lithium and cobalt resources are exhausted?
993,993,"This man gives me the chills,along with his pals…I.Robot all the way."
994,994,"climate catastrophy? people know the sun is going nova eventually, anyway, right?"
995,995,elon musk inspires me to do better for humanity and i am pushing my limits ! its definitely worth it !
996,996,I can't wait for my Robot. Dreamt of this for so long. Less than 10 years is an encouraging timeframe.
997,997,"Thank you Chris! Brilliant interview (as always). I also saw you had David Eagleman on TED2022 for your podcast (can't wait for that one!).
Personally I don't pay much attention to Elon but this was a great overview of his thought processes/interests. "
998,998,The respect for Elon Musk keeps growing everyday. It is very important for next generation to take Elon work as inspiration and make humanity and this planet a better place for everyone.
999,999,"Elon gives a good explanation of how a billionaire can be helping create positive change and growth.  As they say, the billions are on paper, not in his personal consumption.  But they still need to pay some minimum taxes to help pay for the social infrastructure that they use and benefit from."
1000,1000,"what happens when they're hacked, break down or do not respond?"
1001,1001,“Ohhhh don’t trust AI but definitely get connected to the digital super intelligence” -Elon
1002,1002,The only dude to interview Elon  is Joe period
1003,1003,amazing interview with a brilliant scientific entrepreneur 
1004,1004,"This was quite a pleasant interview. Now, if we can get Elon on Hot Ones though... that would definitely be one to look forward to."
1005,1005,I think we are lucky to be alive while Elon is. He does make life and the future more exciting.
1006,1006,“Little meat sticks” 
1007,1007,Thank you for the great interview.  He truly is a gift to humanity.
1008,1008,saw a promise for robot catgirls. Dropped a like :))
1009,1009,Always good to hear intelligent people and Elon especially inspires this 73 year old by cutting through social myths.
1010,1010,"Watch this with friends, family, classmates, or anyone willing to pay attention to the mission. Spread the strength & love. Together, we can change the world. "
1011,1011,Magnificent interview.
1012,1012,I hop We live to see it true
1013,1013,His company has only survived through fiscal intervention in the form of emission credits and he notoriously mistreats people who work in his warehouses and factories. What a hero.
1014,1014,"Magnetic field ️electric field....................

When the hydrocarbons + contaminants of other gasses, are being extracted out the earth, 'the fossil fuels', it's keeping some of the metals under the ground exposed like calcium, magnesium, sodium, IRON, + Other ferromagnetic metals, them metals are attracted by the sun, and the electrons giving off by the moon, makes the planet/these metals more attracted to the sun, it's called ferromagnetism/paramagnetism...."
1015,1015,"I always get excited about the future and being alive when I hear Elon talk. It's an honor to be an investor in $TSLA and hopefully soon in SpaceX, Starlink, Neuralink, and Boring Company."
1016,1016,"This is incredibly important given whats going on in the world right now. Hopefully it will become a thing of the past where nations power flex and have the audacity to wage wars,  exclusive to the fact that their superior ease of access to dirty energy gives them an unfounded sense of superority and control. Clean, renewable and sustainable energy will change all that, and will shift numerous dynamics in ways that will define the story of humanity for at least a millennia. Who is going to win the race?"
1017,1017,"A sobering view about humanity from a man who understands the essence of it. Just simple, straightforward conversation without drama…..
Kudos to Ted’s Interviewer."
1018,1018,"""IF WE CONTINUE TO PUSH HARD, THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT, AND GOOD!"" ️"
1019,1019,Love how he phrases climate question as a fact and Elon shuts it down.
1020,1020,I am more worried about movies becomming real xD
1021,1021,Elon Musk will go down as one of THE most important humans to ever live.
1022,1022,Oh dear. You guys need to do more research on elon musk. This guy is more interested in capital than helping the environment. Dont listen to his lies.
1023,1023,Elon is an inspiration.  He inspires one to be aware of our daily activities and make them purposeful.
1024,1024,I'm a sustainability professional and I'm in favour of what he's doing
1025,1025,"Bad people will create wars, division anything that keeps us focused on them...
Good people...well.... they inspire us.
Thank u Sir for showing a little light in all this darkness."
1026,1026,"35:30 So when Neuralink goes on sale, some dumbass would probably stick one into a monkey and we'll have the real life version of Planet of the Apes."
1027,1027,"16:40 - Using ""beta"" software, still in testing, to drive around  one of the greatest minds of our generation might not be the best idea..."
1028,1028,Peace  out! I’m going to Mars! 
1029,1029,This is really great... I'm more optimistic about the future... Thank you Elon for all the work you do to advance humanity.

1031,1031,Elon will be remembered as one of the if not THE MOST important person in history.. mark my words..
1032,1032,A super market. For public
1033,1033,Elon must be protected at all costs.
1034,1034,Elon for Preident '2040
1035,1035,It'll take a moment  thanks Elon.  We appreciate all you do to ensure our consciousness will expand. I wish all billionaires were more like you.
1036,1036,Thanks Elon. I am a big fan and appreciate your knowledge and constructive criticism on what matters. You have helped me not stay in the moment stressed out in news and politics but to better myself in looking to the future that we can all imagine. Thanks again much love (not in that way) from my bottom of my heart.
1037,1037,Thank you for your contributions to humanity's progress and positive course.
1038,1038,"Apart from enjoying this interview so much as well as unable to stop admiring Elon's mind-blowing visions, I'm just pondering where he's just recovered from an accident or so? Been noticing some of the scars on his face and his neck ^^''."
1039,1039,"He mention aliens which is good ,we all need to know what to expect in coming decades....Elon is very down to earth  genies."
1040,1040,"Ah space apartheid AND furthering atmospheric pollution on the only planet that sustains life.... what a horrible person. At least his charisma makes all the stupid people in the world excited and happy. It's ok that billionaires exist and destroy the planet! I think it's ""cool""!"
1041,1041,5 minutes with Elon and I could blow his mind. Then vice versa. lol He's close. He's just not seen the simple solution yet.
1042,1042,"If Elon Musk wants more money fast then why doesn't he buy YouTube because 270 billion USD - 160 billion USD = 110 billion USD, but the money he'll have left will grow back faster but bigger.

So can you people please email Elon Musk to buy YouTube?"
1043,1043,I'm more impressed by what a good job this interviewer did than by Elon lol
1044,1044,"so good , loved it !"
1045,1045,It takes someone like Elon to come along and state us the obvious for us to listen. We're better than this.
1046,1046,I wish he’d buy google
1047,1047,"He is our Archimedes, he is our Nikola Tesla.. PROTECT HIM."
1048,1048,how about stabilizing the human overpopulation?
1049,1049,"Great interview, intellectually and inspirationally captivating."
1050,1050,“The future is bright and good…. From an energy standpoint” 
1051,1051,Masterclass ️️
1052,1052,excellent
1053,1053,"Elon is a prime example of someone using his wealth to create a better future for everyone. Not all billionaires are greedy a holes, some of them strive to change the world for the better and employ thousands of people along the way."
1054,1054,"No, nuclear war is something to get excited about! Nuclear war is the best thing that could ever happen!"
1055,1055,I could listen to Elon talk forever. You are so lucky to get to pick is brain for a couple of hours. Great Interview
1056,1056,Never seen an interview so clean!
1057,1057,"Thank you for this great interview! I, like many others I imagine, find a peace, which I find nowhere else, we hearing Elon talk and this interview definitely portraits some of the best part of him."
1058,1058,Thank you Elon for everything you do for us
1059,1059,"What do you think about the possibility that the human civilization already came to an end previously (e.g. due to a giant meteor, etc), that we already managed to create multi-planet civilizations (that do exist) and that this world (as we know it) could therefore already be a second attempt on populating the earth...
... imaginable to anyone?"
1060,1060,Worlds most Expensive interview
1061,1061,Excitement and Hope for the future. Amazing.
1062,1062,Tesla cars are expensive how are we going to afford it
1063,1063,"Such an important message. Thank you Elon for giving us all a future to aspire to.

Great work to the interviewer as well. Incredibly well handled."
1064,1064,It seems like Chris Anderson is the boss guiding Elon into the correct/chosen answers and trains of thought -
1065,1065,I love the grounded reality of this channel and Always good to hear your thoughtful and logical analysis. I think we are entering a crab market Personally based purely on what the Fed are doing. Trade a small percentage of your portfolio rather than going in and out every couple weeks trying to time the market  trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 14 BTC when I started at 2.1 BTC in just few weeks implementing Rhonda Castillo's daily trading signals and tips...........
1066,1066,If i had to guess it. This year is NOT the year safe ai driving is coming out.
1067,1067,I feel super optimistic about life after watching Elon's interview.
1068,1068,tesla will be the ff v11 company
1069,1069,Elon Musk makes me glad that there is hope for humanity after all. And this is the most interesting and inspiring interview ever! Thank you both!
1070,1070,"People with their own opinion, Mr. Musk is like 100 steps ahead of most people."
1071,1071,He’s giving the competition the whole plan
1072,1072,TED is good again?
1073,1073,"A question I have never heard about electric vehicles and their batteries/ energy source
Is the radiation that comes out of them safe to humans health? Be good to hear Ellon answer the question"
1074,1074,Normal goes unnoticed as opposed to abnormal will  attract attention a mistake is abnormal
1075,1075,I wonder what Elons vision of a sustainable collective morality/ integrity/ philosophy would be? His really is one of the great intellects of all time. Shaken & Movin!
1076,1076,Words of wisdom! Wow!
1077,1077,What a great interview!
1078,1078,"I hate him with all my guts as a person and entrepreneur but I truly appreciate the idea of trying to be positive. ""If we're not complacent and we have a high sense of urgency towards a sustainable energy economy, I think we will be fine"""
1079,1079,"When Elon is criticized for his enormous wealth, he needs to respond that his wealth is essentially illusory. Given that most of his wealth is held in Tesla stock, there is no way in which he can exchange this stock for dollars. Were he to attempt to do this, the price of Tesla stock would collapse and instead of a share being worth $1,000, it would be worth no more than $10, possibly even as low as a dollar."
1080,1080,You still have to service and repair products... it isn't a one time payment
1081,1081,"That 300 Tera watt estimate may end up being pretty low as population grows and especially the use of more energy in current and newer items.  Most are using least energy they can by not leaving many lights on, unplugging things, and using minimum heat and ac.  Once that is cheaper people will have their houses cooler or warmer, and expand that to basements.  Also we will see new tech using more energy like heated driveways and sidewalks, maybe even basement cement floors, on top of more heated flooring.  Heck, some rich people may even have cooled sidewalks so they can be barefoot outside easier.  Pools will be heated in the winter and maybe made hot as a hot tub.  I can even see heated jackets/clothes.  Once these spiral and new ways to use more energy and that 300 may become a fraction."
1082,1082,Bit of a condescending sounding interview but thanks anyway
1083,1083,Excellent interview. Elon is shaping the world and our future more than many realize. It will take several decades for most to see that.
1084,1084,"I""m of <the opinion that those who leave it to market dynamics to determine when to trade or not are either new to the Market or are probably just naïve. The market has seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders are taking advantage of the dip and pumping even more towards trading sessions. My advice to new investors: More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 15 BTC when I started at 2 BTC in just 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from expert mrs catherine Nathan"
1085,1085,It would be nice to combine Hydro power  with batteries of Elon. I believe by doing this could run all the power grids in 🇺🇸.
1086,1086,
1087,1087,"55:45 yes... It's very annoying to need to commit at least 6 figures to invest. I really want spacex, but it would require me to invest with friends and I'm not confident to say ""let's put collectively 200k+ into this and hope it works""."
1088,1088,This is the clip they play at the beginning of a doomsday movie
1089,1089,"he is very down-to-earth, despite his future goal of going up to earth"
1090,1090,Elon Musk is likely the most loved entrepreneur in the last 100 years.
1091,1091,Elon is our generation’s Einstein
1092,1092,23:43 True.
1093,1093,I feel like Elon and any intelligent alien out there would be best buds
1094,1094,"What don't people understand, what Elon Musk wants to do will not benefit Us the people, WAKE UP"
1095,1095,"Thank you, Chris Anderson, for this thoughtful interview, and thank you, Elon, for being you!"
1096,1096,"I always have a hard time remembering all things I have to do daily. He talked about FSD, Tesla, AI, Neuralink, Space X, etc. with deep knowledge on each subject... unf*believable"
1097,1097,idk but from what I have seen of Mr. Elon Musk he is a class act. I feel positive towards him.
1098,1098,"I don't think he's correct about Wind & Solar being our primary generation source, the power density being abysmal. Certainly there is a place for those sources, and that place will continue to grow, but primary? Actually replacing Oil/Gas/Coal, at the levels we need? I don't see it."
1099,1099,Protect this man at all cost
1100,1100,1:02:39 Elon Musk's companies are philantrophy.
1101,1101,"26:16 this part is dead on. People have this false notion that jobs are finite, and they fundamentally do not understand what a job is and the actual role a job plays. A job is producing that which someone wants but does not yet have. There is a virtual infinity of things people want but do not yet have. Jobs are the chores we must do to produce those goods and services we want...or else we do not have those goods and services if we don't do those chores we currently have to do. If we can make it possible to have those things "
1102,1102,Its painful seeing an old person conduct the interview. The interview isn't bad but its clear that there is a disconnect. Where are the zoomers??
1103,1103,"Very refreshing interview. Many people (myself included) probably didn't know the etymology of ""philanthropy."" Now I do... I'm always learning something from Elon."
1104,1104,"We can build a great future if each one of us takes action. I wasn’t excited about the future for my children and training for a marathon two years ago after watching Game Changers on Netflix, I went Vegan. I have since stayed vegan and if we all went vegan then all 9 danger zones would come back to the safe zone(Attenborough, David, A LIFE ON OUR PLANET.) We all can do something as Elon said; “Take action!” Look at one man can do. I am also a big fan of Bill Gates who is curing disease and building safe water plant to 100% safe Nuclear power plants. His ex-wife is also heavily involved in all projects making three people enormously effective at “taking action!” What are you prepared to do?"
1105,1105,"If this world doesn't make beautiful, intelligible and inspiring men then we are in a bad, bad place...

Thankfully and luckily there are such men out there... Very few but still..."
1106,1106,"24:35 that's it, we are screwed"
1107,1107,"Envision a ""suit of armor"" like Tony Stark wanted, but it is on the ground, all around the earth. It's not armor, but energy, panels arranged all around the earth, making an international solar power station, no matter where you are, you'll always have energy, as the international solar station is always storing energy. Every country can have a local station that stores energy just in case, the energy grid will be shared by all countries, and local stations will be in every country as an emergency measure. Just wanted to give away a ""sci-fi"" version of what can be done to advance as a civilization. Hope it inspires someone to change the world."
1108,1108,"If AI can will terminate  when acting harm intention to human in design criteria, then will stop ""SKYNET"" possible. and AI can not know its own existence but as assistance to life but not life itself, then it will stop a lot of problems before hand."
1109,1109,"Good interview, I agree with virtually everything Elon said except population collapse.  It’s not a reality now but it will be a reality in 40-60 years.  Today, the population is still growing, with relatively archaic farming, manufacturing and energy production means, but the will all change in the coming decades."
1110,1110,Elon is the man !!!
1111,1111,Elon is a superhero. Period.
1112,1112,"I want to be the First United Methodist Minister on Mars, Man!"
1113,1113,"While I like the specifics of what he says, there are large gaps in his vision of a bright future.  Biodiversity, resource sustainability, and wealth distribution, to name three.  The wellbeing of most people remains at risk while a small number of billionaires inhibit wealth redistribution and subvert public policy.  Even Ford understood he had to improve the lives of his workers in order to have a middle-class that could afford his products.  I love his vision of the future, but it can't be a bright future for only a few."
1114,1114,
1115,1115,How can you not love the vision of this man?
1116,1116,Can't wait to buy my wife in the future. Elon must be protected at all costs!
1117,1117,"Ever seen's I discovered Elon Muck's and watch everything he does making me Excited and have a higher hope for what can be done in the future, I feels lucky to be alive in Elon time by the way his only a year older than me how crazy is that? Bless you Elon Everything about you is unbelievable."
1118,1118,Wish I had 1 hour to watch this video. Thank you.
1119,1119,Amazing 10 STARS!!! We are blessed to have Elon Musk.
1120,1120,Mars on National Geographic CHannel was an amazing docu about going to mars.
1121,1121,The interviewer is clearly trying to manage Musk’s excitement
1122,1122,Project Mars a technical tail Dr. Wernher von Braun. A good read…
1123,1123,Thanks for being such a good guy Elon.. To many narcissistic people have bullied and harassed this guy his who life. I'm greatful to be alive during the time of Elon Musk!
1124,1124,"Elon Musk needs to partner with Underdog Electric inc., for a fixed electric bill to save us from the utility companies energy grab. Fixed bill for all residential electrical service. Then we all could drive electrical vehicles'. Elon could make it happen."
1125,1125,"I'm excited about hempcrete homes, off grid solar, a legal defi system, tidal stream power, some geothermal, next gen nuclear, I like plug in hybrids but think a big battery is itself more wasteful than using gas at times, I think spraying the atmosphere with sulphur dioxide is fine to combat some of the ghg effects, and that China should develop Africa for resources like they've been and help provide family planning and food if they're cooperative enough. I hope we desalinate or maybe start catching rainwater on the ocean's surface and barge it places. I also hope the msm crash and burn and people take liberties seriously including legalizing more controlled substances in a responsible and controlled way, and move out of cities voluntarily to go green and local and raise healthy families while not worrying too much about CO2 till 600ppm. Should be nice."
1126,1126,It's like the promise of the Industrial rev where we are all on holiday now. bollocks basically
1127,1127,Elon sometimes has a Vulcan quality to him.
1128,1128,Too bad 95% of this is vaporware :(
1129,1129,Thank you Elon for your efforts
1130,1130,"I love how much can get done on “guesswork”
6:01"
1131,1131,"""If you want the future to be good, you must make it so"". it hits hard coming from him. I don't think it's just about climate change, it's about anyone's own life. It's just congruent and put in that precise way finally clicks. 
he says ""take action, and it will be"". that's reassuring."
1132,1132,Elon the beekeeper thinking outside the box.(check)
1133,1133,Long-term TSLA investor community love! 
1134,1134,he dosnt understand or knows what greed is thats his problem. just because a big company can replace that 40k a year worker with a one of payment of 25k dosnt mean they will drop the price of that $2000 handbag down to $200 they will milk every $$$
1135,1135,"ELON MUSK YOU ARE A GENIUS, GOODHEARTED AND SENSITIVE TOWARDS HUMANITY. I LOVE THE WAY YOU THINK CONSTRUCTIVELY. YOU ARE MY HERO!!!"
1136,1136,"This is what makes Elon Musk so special to me: the courage to - somehow -  maintain a genuinely level head (while all around us are losing theirs). He considers all the trouble we've managed to create for ourselves (as all children do) as inflections of learning and opportunity, not terminal signs of inevitable doom.

That's why I like, admire and trust him so much. Regardless of the ""strengths and weaknesses"" metric, (which is actually pretty irrelevant) to me, the vastly more important point is that he's just good."
1137,1137,"A living legend, Elon is the albert einstein and Benjamin franklin of modern time. We should appreciate that we are alive witnessing this in real time. We love you Elon."
1138,1138,Elon would make Nikola Tesla really proud for his contribution to humanity. Best billionaire to date.
1139,1139,"Tree is just in, @21:50, Teslas droids will give free piggy back rides anywhere you want to go!!

As Elon said, BIGGER THAN THE CAR!!!"
1140,1140,i feel like the interviewer could have done a way better job.
1141,1141,I am so happy that I have learned English and now I can watch this masterpiece in original! God bless you Elon!
1142,1142,Elon asked how are you and he didn't even bother to respond...
1143,1143,"""If you want the future to be good, you must make it so."" Elon Musk"
1144,1144,"I don't understand how he sees a labour shortage in the future. Maybe like hyper educated, engineering type labour shortage. But if he's putting all janitors, all labour jobs, driver, jobs, and construction jobs out of business, then what kind of demand is he expecting?"
1145,1145,"Sleeping on the factory floor. That's ownership! Look at him now, not even talking about his wealth, thats just an effect of his causation. I didn't know he also has Aspergers. I admire your dedication Mr Musk."
1146,1146,Solving leftist brain injury would be awesome...
1147,1147,"2nd comment: Elon talks of a Great Gravity and so hard to get to Mars, but easier to come back. Is Earth like Quicksand to underpowered interstellar travellers?"
1148,1148,inb4 the dialectics hit
1149,1149,Very good interview that everyone should see.
1150,1150,"I hope at least when im old, I could be on mars. It would be the best photo of my entire life."
1151,1151,"7:00  It wont be low cost for the consumer, just more profitable for the seller"
1152,1152,In Jesus name 
1153,1153,"Great interviewer...he was able to draw out so much by his intelligent questions.
Is there any way to pass messages directly to Elon?"
1154,1154,when is he gonna learn how to properly pronounce English words
1155,1155,Again and again Elon Musk is on God Mode   What a Genius we have among us  
1156,1156,"So far this is one of the best interviews I have ever seen. Surely, Elon Musk is of the great people and make the AI Evolution in the decade now.  Especially I am craving this quote from Elon """"If you want the future to be good, then make it so. Take action, and it'll be good"" Elon Musk 2022"
1157,1157,"Genius of our time, love his view of life and morals. Keep punching and ignore the haters"
1158,1158,"So considering Elon's hourly rate, this is a 100 million dollar interview...."
1159,1159,I feel as though Elon is our American President. He certainly cares more for the people and our land . Plus he is doing something about it
1160,1160,Why the heck would you leave Cali because of how they run things to go to the one place in texas that runs them the same way.
1161,1161,Small part of that study said 2050 more say 2100 it’s a graph with probability and there are huge differences in opinion
1162,1162,Jealous people who do not see the hard work behind it to get that money. They just see the end result and start comparing their own reality with successful people and get envious so they start criticising but do not anything meaningful to even get to a million.
1163,1163,Brilliant conversation 
1164,1164,Electric rocket could be as easy as thinking of a rail gun maybe not as crude but the rail would work outward from a spiral saving room but the g force would be another thing
1165,1165,"It’s hilarious how this dude is trying to convince Elon to merge his companies. I’m pretty sure he’s thought about this and many different way, then  your brain could possibly do . Lol !"
1166,1166,Elon Musk
1167,1167,"a better question for robots putting people out of work would be....
what if companies hired other peoples robots, so that people can still make money but never have to have a human work if they don't want to?   i.e disabled persons. survive but not worry about money. A.i. cars A.i. robots. we as humans should be able to enjoy life, not work our whole life."
1168,1168,"A future of abundance, things will be cheap.   year sure, but opportunities to earn money will be drastically reduced."
1169,1169,"Combing tunnels, electric high-speed rail, and the energy grid would solve the two main problems with our country's infrastructure. Only Musk can make it happen."
1170,1170,The only drawback to stopping burning of petroleum and coal is that with a cooler Earth settlements closer to the poles may need to be abandoned
1171,1171,"interesting questions, well done"
1172,1172,"Technology is Not Personality Cult.
Cults exist in Business, as in Religion."
1173,1173,Elon Musk is a hero.
1174,1174,Hahahahahaha Elon Musk tells the climate zoomer to calm down.
1175,1175,Possibly the most famous human alive. For all the right reasons.
1176,1176,If you can achieve operational mini reactors you don't need the battery capacity.
1177,1177,"Thanks for this interview!!!
such inspiration to behold "
1178,1178,I'd like Elon to be the president of the USA solving actual problems and issues without what's going on today.
1179,1179,"I have a theroy, but I think we have all  been apart of the human labelling system Elon speaks of and we contribute to it every time we try to log onto websites, think about when it asks us to identity either all the busses/bridges/cross walks etc, within the group of images to prove we are real people logging in to these websites, I reckon they are mining this data to help speed up the process of labelling these specific images that will be used to build the real AI system for self driving cars haha and it doesn't cost Elon a cent to gain this data. But like I say just a random theroy "
1180,1180,There is no climate problem.
1181,1181,I don't understand how anyone could possibly hate Elon
1182,1182,What about free energy devices? What about that technology ELONNNNN??
1183,1183,"""I'm not one of those doomsday people."" Lol this man is awesome "
1184,1184,"AI video labeling:  AI is learning it's first words, how to crawl/walk, appropriate social behavior for vehicles in the road."
1185,1185,For now on I’m going to listen to this every day for falling asleep for my siesta
1186,1186,Self driving problems is that because there is no designated line for it and people want to have option in current stage.
1187,1187,How on earth does a capitalistic world speak about low cost when their goal is to make as much profit as they can?We are not all fools mate .Don’t forget that the human brain develops every time a new technology is introduced to its mind.
1188,1188,Can someone please take care of this TED channel people
1189,1189,Imagine showing someone this interview 10 years ago
1190,1190,"I will give Elon 5 times his shares value, 60 minutes offer. Subject to investors."
1191,1191,"Advancements in tools can be a fine thing.  But even if we were able to achieve faster than light travel, build Mr. Fuller’s elevators, or construct a Dyson sphere, we’d still be stuck with who and what we are.  And we all know what stinkers humans are, and that will never change.  Leastwise, not in the current configuration. "
1192,1192,"pro nuclear? there is a nuclear plant in plymouth ma, and if that thing ever had a meltdown my whole area would dead."
1193,1193,This is literally like Jesus on earth. Bro is solving almost every world problem
1194,1194,"Elon, your hair looks much better now....you nearly looked like Kim yon un.....Please keep it grow back to normal! How are we going to ever use your cars in SA or anywhere if electricity is such a great problem....or worse, if the sun get so bad we can't use solar.....Once the energy crisis is sorted, you will have a market for everything! If all the nations stop testing their bombs, even the ""global warming"" crisis will be solved...but hey.....we will always have to fight evil!"
1195,1195,"I hope every year, all the smartest college new graduates go to work for one of Elon’s companies."
1196,1196,"I would like to one day do what he does or at least come close in my own nature, it's very exciting, this is absolute freedom and mastery of the human design, creating to hearts delight! Well done Elon!"
1197,1197,I'm loving these TED2022 related Elon content drops!! 
1198,1198,Worth watching again.
1199,1199,"Some people hate him, some people adore him. Whatever you think of Elon Musk, he has achieved what others couldn't do in a thousand lives. 
Personally I am more excited about the future because of what he has done and most likely also what he will continue to do."
1200,1200,Youtubers in 2050-2080 are gonna be trying to sneak into mars. lol
1201,1201,"Where do you get the Lithium for the batteries from? is it sustainable? and if it isn't, is it better than the current sources of energy that we have at the moment?"
1202,1202,So oil is not sustainable??? BS!!! Gas is NATURAL !  ITS EVEN IN THE NAME!!! therefore  NATURAL MEANS SUSTAINABLE!!
1203,1203,"This was probably the best interview on elon musk I've seen, and I've seen a lot"
1204,1204,"Did you catch that bit at @22:10?

Elon: “As long as the AI doesn’t take over and murder us in our sleep.”"
1205,1205,I would say to build a better future for humanity we need to get rid of the corrupt politicians that just want to line thier bank accounts for thier corrupt families. That would be a great start. Ijs.
1206,1206,brb; need to go buy more shares…
1207,1207,"""Elon Musk, great to see you, how are you?""
""Good, how are you?""
ignores
proceeds with interview"
1208,1208,The Talented Mr. Ripley
1209,1209,Such a great interview! Elon is such an awesome human being. How is it possible for a multi-billionaire to have and keep such a good moral compass and be so down-to-earth?
1210,1210,Hope he has the integrity and independence to distance himself from the WEF.
1211,1211,It's quite scary to see the amount of terribly executed paraphrasing the media has done since this interview went live. Equally scary that people who comment on those clickbait articles share their unsolicited opinions based only on the opinion article headlines.
1212,1212,The plants breath carbon 
1213,1213,Today I was listening to a ted talk by Elon Musk while cleaning my house and I rarely post on here but I absolutely loved what was said. (Paraphrasing here) “The future is something that you can look forward to and not something to feel sad about. You want to get up in the morning and be excited for the future and we should fight for the things that make us excited about the future. The future cannot be about one miserable thing after another... Solving one sad problem after another… there’s got to be things that get you excited… like you want to live.” 
1214,1214,Batteries are not infinite sorry to say. Tell me what happens when you run out of batteries. Go back to basics they work.. Elon once you can perfected an organic Battery that runs and reproduces energy as efficiently as an ox or horse. Let us know.
1215,1215,The billionaire with a mission to make a difference. More power to you sir keep scaling to get your vision done sooner than later 
1216,1216,"Mr. Musk, use your money to devolope your own carbon capture tech, I've read about Norway pulling in carbon from the air. It gives me hope in the future"
1217,1217,"One honest question I have about full self-driving is, would it make a major difference or no difference at all to install sensors in the road in order for the car to read a sort of data algorithm in the road. 
For instance, perhaps a flat lying object with a barcode that forces the car to read active data from a network that you can install along the roadway that it reads as a sort of barcode, a sort of infrared beam that bounces back to the sort of allow the car to focus mostly on whats ahead, perhaps you could have a seperate network to allow for road crews, emergency crews, etc to send data to a network and your car can receive that data in real time, so that the car can predict those types of things and plan for it."
1218,1218,"I can see maid robots being thoroughly abused and tested by kids for: 
- asking it to make 'tea' while sneaking in explosive ingredients
- asking for help at beating up the neighbour's kid (and/or his robot)
- faking the round-picture for its 8 cameras, or replacing that ROM with a piratebay one, to make them do the above"
1219,1219,"Positive thinking is the only way to grow.  Keep in mind possible problems, but always think that problems must be surpassed."
1220,1220,"Visionary to capitalist basically overnight. It's unfortunate, he was a good one..."
1221,1221,Send your robots as advance workers so people can arrive to a working destination.
1222,1222,you can turn water into fuel
1223,1223,"4:33 Awesome response!  This is encouraging others to adopt the scientific system, where others can also feel free to calculate what that number is to arrive at their own conclusions, and if we all arrive at the same conclusions, that is a scientific way seen in medicine, astronomy, physics, etc. (pubmed or nature magazine +REP)"
1224,1224,"People accusing Musk that he is a fake and all smoke & mirrors should watch this. If this is an act, than we are looking at the best actor that ever lived."
1225,1225,The bad thing about electric cars is that the government can turn it off whenever it feels like to
1226,1226,Save soil !!! Otherwise all this technology wont matter what so ever.
1227,1227,"""Show the progress with your hands Elon"". 
Like plenty of people aren't just listening to this."
1228,1228,I'm surprised for this content. In the past TED Talks even published a conference from an activist that advocates for paedophilia.
1229,1229,Elon makes me proud to be human.
1230,1230,"Please can you talk to Elon again about the human birth rate, because I don’t like our overcrowded cities all over the world. Is it because economic growth depends on population growth? Surely we will find better circular economic systems for more local sustainability…"
1231,1231,"One thing that I took from this interview is that in 10 years from now the majority of humanity will have a robot at home. 

This is going to happen just like when Bill Gates predicted at the start of computer revolution that everyone will have a computer at home in just a few years."
1232,1232,"To much editing... imo.  Otherwise, thanks."
1233,1233,"Did Elon Musk even visit a school? In how far is wind and solar energy, the way we produce it, sustainable? Lots of rare commodities are needed which would cause the same dilemma that coal and oil has, it is a limited resource. Recycling these isn't that easy too..."
1234,1234,Why can't elon mention hydrogen
1235,1235,Because of Elon we can all be optimistic about the future of this beautiful world.
1236,1236,I started the video for an insight on our future and I stayed for robot cat girls :D
1237,1237,"Obviously don't know Elon personally but love how open & honest he is in every interview. Just can't get that with Bezos, Gates, or the worst Zuckerberg."
1238,1238,"At the risk of it, I will, its going to be super great. The grand games, will absorb so much time from people, there will be concerns made in news on tv about it. We'll manage though.

A future we will fight for? is Elon's fight the same as members of the syndicates? That hope to avoid answering to God by staying here in popular support? We need not risk these elites among other elites to consider sending back every chance they need - with doing their ""transendence"" here instead of under the observation of God's angels. Answers are more important than Biden's and every high ranked public figure of the syndicates saying ""lets be loving, and not bother god with the unimportant task of getting answers from these innocent and loving people that have done absolutely nothing wrong and are not in suspicion of anything either, despite that [insert biblical wicked-symbol] saying they all are in question of siphoning HIS god given genius."
1239,1239,მაგარი ტიპი ხარ ილონ : )))
1240,1240,"I am not an alarmist, we are doing fine, we just have to move forward making good decisions- is that a good paraphrase? It is so refreshing to see someone who actually accomplishes something positive not using fear and manipulation to accomplish his goals."
1241,1241,"Love this, yes the future  is bright and good.    God is our future and will always supply our needs and will use the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.  He will even use the wise to fulfill His plan.  I see nowhere where God gets the credit."
1242,1242,"People think this dude is not in the big club and cares about humanity lol  Meanwhile, dude is downloading his brain onto some AI platform somewhere and pushing transhumanism."
1243,1243,"I love how you keep pushing the climate issue and he just shrugs it off. The man is worried about peak oil, not climate."
1244,1244,Somebody show ELon ANimatrix and the rise of the machines before he goes balls deep on robots.
1245,1245,How much more affordable and cooperative should STEM education become for workers to keep up with the jobs created by automation ?
1246,1246,Amber Heard is on Elon Musk's mind.
1247,1247,"Why would governments pay citizens to leave and possibly never contribute those funds to economy?  Why would banks loan it if people would no longer work and make payments?  Loans like that would probably need to be secured.  Who are these ""almost anyone"" that can save up $100k?"
1248,1248,Mars sounds like the Fyre festival.
1249,1249,"Elon Musk. This man will be remembered throughout human history as one of the greatest and most influential minds.
Thank you for everything."
1250,1250,Elon is aware of the adeptus mechanicus
1251,1251,Ai has no ability for unpredictability which is where everyone is failing. Nothing is predictable apart from a good quarterly statement. If one made such a thing and it was self aware with a wealth of information. People would be a thing of the past. Automation is the way of the future. That doesn't need advanced ai.
1252,1252,41:44 Y'all notice the thing that happened here either?
1253,1253,No house nice. Couch surfing Elon!!! Love it
1254,1254,AGGRESSIVE timeline CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IN ASIA
1255,1255,"Brilliant interviewer, entertaining questions and answers"
1256,1256,"He's motivated by the lack of doubt.
He's thought about it and he's bringing it out "
1257,1257,Can we talk about how calming his voice is 
1258,1258,Autonomous vehicles can be a real problem to humans... Not sure is a real worthy problem to solve in the current world....what if the car controls can be overited remotely by authorities or a bad person and denial form service? Also how many people will be left without jobs?
1259,1259,"Without those hopeful and excited for the future, we would have nobody to fighting for the best of the future. Thank you Elon for being one of the few putting their wealth towards the betterment of us all."
1260,1260,What ever happened to teaching our children common sense and VERY basic driving skills?
1261,1261,"Elon Musk thinks: Human brain, but without the animal bits?  

We do exist.  Cyborgs. Now. We can populate Mars, or anywhere.



Many support systems keep my old animal brain still under maintenance. Medically, we do exist. Severe traumatic brain injury from 1984, traffic accident, Sydney, Australia."
1262,1262,I'm investing in a company where you can lease an Ai Robot to go work for you...go least you a work Robot because in the future you human will not be able to be compete for some high paying jobs.
1263,1263,"The majority of the world is rooting for you, Elon! Stay encouraged, you are in so many ways saving humanity from so much evil."
1264,1264,"Two things.  Abundant goods implies huge use of natural resources and degradation of the environment.  Abundant services implies putting people who supply these services out of jobs. There is a job pyramid where there are a few intellectuals and managers at the top and many workers who produce the goods and services. What will the people who provide all those goods and services do if their labor is no longer needed?   Losing one's job is a psychologically jarring event in one's life.  If they lose them to machines,  it would only make people feel their life increasingly pointless. Then. too, many people start at the bottom of companies and work their way up. How will people do that if all the entry level positions are filled with robots?  I do not think Musk has thought out all the implications of robots and what they will do to society.  Here is another thing. Currently there is a gap between the rich and the poor.. Could there also develop a gap between those with robot and those without. Thos with would have an enorous advantage."
1265,1265,Elon is our frontier of the free work scientist. He sometimes has blond and sometimes brunette woman and we be quite.
1266,1266,"i cannot imagine a future,  with elon musk flamethrowers in it."
1267,1267,It sucks to think that the future is only bright for those with money and in position of privilege. For the rest is to handle the worst that life can throw at you. The racial divide makes this even harder for most. What a sad world for the majority. But there's hope for happiness if you have a good attitude and work hard.
1268,1268,If crypto money and the great reset happen the future will suck
1269,1269,"Very few leave towering legacies of impact (Carnegie, Ford, Knuth etc) Something tells me that by the time Elon Musk is done, his shall be the most powerful of them all."
1270,1270,"interviewer is smoking Elon's pole here a bit. ""Some people think you having a sickening amount of wealth is sickening, I don't, got a spare fiver?"""
1271,1271,"Печально смотреть это интервью из России 2022 года. Когда одна страна планирует улучшение экологии, рост, эволюцию, другая погружает себя и соседние страны в чёрное кровавое средневековье"
1272,1272,The amount of innovation and global change this one incredible human being is creating is completely mind blowing.
1273,1273,"Now he finally talks about tiny wires, we don’t need tiny wires. He is connecting to a superbrain, the problem yes as he is right. We invested Sigmund Freud and are the forefront of Psychology. No there is nothing to fix. Just help us to keep peace we don’t want to fight against idiots really. Please ."
1274,1274,49:00 Elon is mortal!? brah wtf :-(
1275,1275,54:18 FSD for Mumbai and Indian cities would be an incredible achievement for the real world AI. No kidding.
1276,1276,"Robots playing catch with your kids…oh what a sweet picture that is. 

Kid: Teslabot, can you be my dad??"
1277,1277,He's a really good interviewer
1278,1278,Where's all the lithium coming from for these batteries? and the ecological impact of this lithium extraction.
1279,1279,Elon let’s talk about mining for lithium…. How bad is it for the eco system?
1280,1280,man billions of dollars and seats have no backrest. take a break Elon!
1281,1281,"With all the talk of robots I couldn't help but think of the film ""Robot & Frank"". Aside from being a good story it is one of the best representations of a benign and useful in-home robot. For anyone scared of a future with robots I'd suggest a watch to put your mind at ease since it is most likely how they'd be implemented (huge market + achievable tech)."
1282,1282,Lets go back to raising and using horses to move things.
1283,1283,In order to have more people like Elon Musk we need to embrace aspergers and the creative approach in general.  Education needs to change.
1284,1284,You get me pumping!!
1285,1285,Im surprised that cabal hasnt killed Elon off. The abal would be losing their money
1286,1286,"NO thanks mister futurist man, I don't want my brian hacked."
1287,1287,"There are so many people, extremely motivated to do something good and/or driven by curiosity just as Elon mentioned. They feel like building pyramids (no of course not pyramids, but something big and great that people believe in) but yet, they seem to be on a ship going somewhere/nowhere else without tools and no land in sight."
1288,1288,Elon knows we are fucked!!!
1289,1289,Elon Musk gives me hope to live in future
1290,1290,"Forget what media says, they have their own views. This man is speaking facts."
1291,1291,I wonder if you can make concrete from Martian sands
1292,1292,Where does all the battery waste end up?
1293,1293,Ghost in the Shell becoming a reality
1294,1294,"Would like to help you with the population crisis using your DNA, Elon. Please send tell."
1295,1295,Sometimes I think he really is reborn Nikola Tesla but this time and in this life learned his lesson to make money so he can support his projects.
1296,1296,"It is a very in depth and revealing interview. But I'd wish for a better interviewer. Less interruptions and presumptive questions.  There are many little poorly thought out things that Chris throws in, i.e. at 55:24 he mentions Neural Link used as a telepathic connection between people on Mars and loved ones back on Earth. Does he not know the transmission times* between the two planets ? , and stop calling it ""telepathy"" when it would still be like communication technology here on Earth using a smart phone.   * about 5 to 20 minutes for a radio signal to travel the distance between Mars and Earth, depending on planet positions. Would be better as a sort of visual voice mail conversation or simple email text."
1297,1297,"I love how much down to earth and non quirky (for my world view...i am a pure mathematician) Elon is in this video. You can troll on twitter and have ""scandals"", if youre on point and professional in important situations. This ambivalence seems to much to comprehend to most media. BTW: That robot could help my farmer friend harvesting pumpkins. He has backpain and will give up soon on this dreadful task you dont find people to help you for. He's 35 now. No more hokkaidos for the people around here."
1298,1298,"Elon, whatever we do, please promise you'll make the first one a woman, as they give rise to the rest and name her Rosie."
1299,1299,The world needs a president of planet earth. I nominate Elon Musk.

1301,1301,"Nowadays everyone has a smartphone that can do tons of things, I can imagine if every household has at least one robot that can help out with things like cooking/cleaning, even talking to you, going travel with you. People will be less argumentative in the household about things like who is going to clean dishes, who will get the crash out, etc,so probably the marriage rate (and the divorce rate ) will be dropped dramatically. I'm looking forward to owning a human-minded robot that can do all those wonderful for or with me haha I was actually thinking and wishing Elon Mask can make this happen before I watch this video...Now I""m counting on him "
1302,1302,Can you produce a rocket that farts out loads of social housing Elon ? So people don't have to feel like crap whilst we listen to crap.
1303,1303,We really needed this: an optimistic and concrete view of our near future
1304,1304,"He is not really a leader like our german Hitler was. We need to work together. It’s the force of will that always services. He is very close to foresee the future but this intention lies still within Germany. The force of will still lies still in the middle of Europe. But he is a vehicle to solve the problem, and that is of the highest value. That ambiguity resolves."
1305,1305,How much of our labor shortage is nothing more than a misallocation of labor?  How many millions of otherwise able people are sitting in useless jobs?  How many bushels of organic produce could be picked by the thousands of diversity hiring and diversity compliance officers?  How many streets could be swept and cleaned by the tens of thousands of underemployed liberal arts college graduates?  How many factory jobs could be filled by the millions of people collecting unemployment benefits?
1306,1306,the guy is a real blender...
1307,1307,"Hey Elon, the world is not a better place because you are creating and selling more Teslas."
1308,1308,"I like elon musk    I wish he would pay for a good hair cut    I like Tesla's but I can't afford one and I want to actually drive my car, not have it drive me (till I'm just too old to safely do it)    I don't want to go to mars    I dont need a flame thrower or a tunnel made      I don't use twitter but would love for all have access to a freer speech platform   So Really I dont need or want what he has to offer   but as a person I have no problem with him and I love his straight forward approach to life   Go Get em ELON"
1309,1309,I can't like this interview enough!
1310,1310,"Try to put a wind turbine on a big rig that is pulling eighty thousand pounds and see how far it's going to get you down the road! And very few people are buying electric cars. It will be a very long time before that will change. If the world's climate is going to change there is not a thing we can do about it! It has throughout history had cold and warm oscillations. Even if we eliminated all carbon, including humans, if the world is going to heat up, it's going to heat up! The world could care less about carbon!"
1311,1311,Elon don't you think that's there is a possibility of a new power source.
1312,1312,"Left turn, Road blockage, Car stops in oncoming traffic."
1313,1313,"Basically, Elon is giving us more options but he can’t save the world. I have mad respect for him "

1317,1317,"Elon vs Blackrock and Wall Street. 

I take Elon every time."
1318,1318,"Wow..just wow. Elon is the greatest man alive right, hands down. This was an epic interview with so much vision, hope and drive to push humanity into the future. His last words at the end will resonate throughout history for a very long time."
1319,1319,such an excellent interview...Chris Anderson is such a good interviewer. really glad to catch this on youtube
1320,1320,Then War happens 
1321,1321,"If there's one person in our generation deserving of being a ""Great Person"" in the next Civilization game, it sure is Elon Musk"

1326,1326,"I'm probably not going to be popular when I say this because everyone is falling head over heels for this guy. I don't trust him. I don't trust anyone with 285 BILLION dollars. Who is he, Where did he come from and how did he get that rich? These are questions we should ALL BE asking. For now I say watch him closely. TRUST NO MAN!"
1327,1327,"Great interview, great inspiration for mankind...... "
1328,1328,I'd imagine deep space exploration would be carried out by AI Androids as the human body just isn't designed for long periods of space travel. At the very least the ship would have to generate earth gravity to prevent bone damage and muscle waste. Without that we will never leave our solar system. Plus humans would have to hibernate or failing that live procreate and die for generations on the ship to reach even the nearest star.
1329,1329,"Elon Musk is beautiful ( :

lots of people so sad about future, and that’s not great.
we really want to wake up and look forward to the future. We want to be excited about what’s going to be happen...and life can’t simply be about sort of,solving one miserable problem after another ."
1330,1330,"Great interview! Makes me wonder what can I do to support the future of humanity?…I guess let’s start by having many kids, buy a Tesla and try to live with sustainability at the center of the daily decision making."
1331,1331,Its impressive  how Elon can explain complex computing problems to simple people and still its impressive how some of them still do not understand that.
1332,1332,ELON SHOULD WORK ON HIS OUTSIDE INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS OF ANY OUTSIDE SUPPLY CHAIN COMPANIES SEEN AS BENEFICIAL TO ELON'S COMPANIES' FUTURE.
1333,1333,"Thank you Elon for all you do. 

One day I will also aid humanity in achieving their goal of becoming noble explorers of our reality. Wether by harvesting celestial body’s or vessels with all our creature comforts from earth, I will dedicate myself to achieving progression."
1334,1334,"Sorry to say, but Elon's boys have it wrong about starship capture..It needs to land in a hole in the ground, with the capture being achieved by an aperture mechanism.. It will also have a massive reduction in pollution if the landing fails.."
1335,1335,We need more ‘Elons’. Thanks for this interview guys. The future is bright
1336,1336,What would be mind-blowing is that the actual fuel plant can be integrated to the starship. So that starship can self-refuel from solar energy and water ice.
1337,1337,Really good interview. I wish Elon good health and a long life.
1338,1338,"Good interview covering  a range of Elon's views but would have liked to see a bit more of a push-back on some of the widely optimistic claims. In particular, the view that that a one-way flight to Mars could cost as little as $100,000 within the next 50 years even before a single drop of water has been extracted from the Martian surface. Such amount is unlikely to even pay for the space suite or the pre-flight training, life-support or Martian habitat."

1341,1341,I never can understand why some people hate elon musk so much. Elon musk is more interactive and human acting than most billionaires and doesn't spend his money on a bunch of selfish stuff like yachts. I feel like people don't like him for the same reason alot of people didn't like trump which was because he was real and didn't hold back how he felt about things. Elon musk is the same way he doesn't act like a different person for the public he acts like who he is and I think that's an amazing thing for the world richest person to do.
1342,1342,Damn these youtube ads too long nowadays
1343,1343,Is there anyone comparable to him? Its a rarity to see someone that rich and powerful to actually care beyond their own greed.
1344,1344,"I agree with everything Elon says here until his comment about population. If he has any faith in the Tesla bot why should he worry about a labor shortage?

Increasing the population just increases the demand on energy, infrastructure and all the required sub systems to support the increased population. If he’s annoyed with traffic now how much worse will it be with billions more on the planet?"
1345,1345,"Gotta love Elon Madoff. Who lies more, Elon, Trump, or Hillary?"
1346,1346,The best you could do is 1080p? Ya'll having budget cuts?
1347,1347,"Elon's vision, creativity and drive are truly remarkable. Of course much of what he is doing is hugely disruptive, hence vigorous push back from some quarters is inevitable."
1348,1348,The interviewer sounds like Stewie Griffin.
1349,1349,"I like you, Elon. As in, I like the way you think and present your ideas."
1350,1350,"It wasn't quite as good at Bill Gates, but  keep practicing... you've gotten so much better at public speaking!"
1351,1351,There is no ultimate sense of purpose without God.

1353,1353,"We don't value this man enough, in 400 years will be remembered being much more influential than Da Vinci, Bell or any other great inventor, if life has a great future a big part will be thanks to Elon, it's a fact"
1354,1354,theres a gabillion kids in india population fine
1355,1355,In Elon we trust
1356,1356,His hairline just keeps getting better and it gives some hope to me
1357,1357,"The fact that billions of people, in one way or another, put so much trust ""faith"" in so few people is, in my opinion, one of the biggest retarders of our collective intelligence/potential/progress."
1358,1358,Wow I'm actually kinda blown away by all this. Great interview.
1359,1359,"Imagine 200 years from now, when our children are watching this interview...the first discussions about interplanetary travel."
1360,1360,Wow
1361,1361,How is it possible for anyone to NOT love Elon. His vision for the future and empathy for mankind is unparalleled. I learn something every time I watch an interview.
1362,1362,Is it just me or are Humans becoming bad at speaking without repeating every other word like a stutter? O.o
1363,1363,Elon Musk is the only human i 100% trust and believe in. love you Elon
1364,1364,"""things will be fine"" ""as long as we are not complacent""

I really don't understand the hate Elon gets."
1378,1378,"Instead of FSD I would like to see the most reliable , capable, simple, and affordable EV become the immediate focus. Something that takes the place of SUV and standard pickup, while being as iconic as a VW bug or a model T."
1379,1379,"He really is a brilliant, man. I don't just mean he's a genius because obviously he is, but he is using his brain and companies all to build a better and brighter future if Elon is hopeful for the future then so am I."
1380,1380,Elan like most wealthy people realize people in general are fools so buy his flame thrower
1381,1381,The real value of Elon's work it's how many young people its being inspired by his example...I am sure in the decades to come will be an explosion of Elons Musks...

1384,1384,"One need ""guts"" to even think and imagine something at that level. All the projects Elon is planning are certainly output of careful consideration of right utilization of (investors) money and time. Some critics can always debate about the collateral damage (if any) that can occur during the due course. But i think, its the risk he intends to take."

1410,1410,"Classy way delivering the good revelations ""let it be star trek cheers Elon "
1411,1411,Great interview 
1412,1412,"This egoist is so desperately trying to be smart in front of Elon, he destroyed potentionaly perfect interview. Couple of times he just cuts Elon at the end of and answer, we do not even get an answer."
1413,1413,Elon has done so much good in this world
1414,1414,yesss give us those masonic hand signs. Now we know whom you serve! THanks!
1415,1415,love him or hate him. Elon sticks with Tesla and SpaceX through all the turmoil. Him being there was the biggest assurance for shareholders.
1416,1416,"just started watching.. to the questions on the optimistic future, elon talks about his confidence in using 8 cameras..  i felt that was a jump on time horizons and the future of our planet in terms of clean and affordable energy systems. and the nextnow which has to deal with improving the algorithms for improved resolution. Made me wonder which was the weaker link, the technological prowness or the human nature. Hope elon buys out twitter and entirely replaces the  board members, with more accountability and transparency to the freedom of expression in the world. Now that could be a nextnow with a future impact."
1417,1417,"By 2077, this interview will be part of Elon's career's genesis series and when he was still poor!"
1418,1418,"i think it's going to be an important feature to not surrender the feeling that arises from conducting activities that allow us to understand the worth of what is in front of us.  deliberation is a function that is improved upon by acting; and if we slave away the process of such interactions that are fundamental to ownership and love towards others, we honestly weaken our stance as a species, imo.  convenience isn't always the best solution to building a better life."
1419,1419,"Errr for other words, the entire world needs about 3,000 giga factories of battery production to switch totally to 100% environmentally sustainability.  I think that is doable.  
.
Honestly I don't care as much about the environment.  I'm excited about the fact that monopolies will most likely be broken."
1420,1420,"all hail
Supreme Leader 
Kim Jong Musk"
1421,1421,In the future we will look back at the life of Elon Musk as we do now at the life of Newton and Einstein.
1422,1422,Elon can test nurolink on me. I have severe depression and addictive personality
1423,1423,"It’s easy to have a conversation about how great the future is looking when you completely ignore the very real facts of unbridled climate change which will almost certainly warm the planet beyond the “safe limit” of 1.5 degrees, the pervasive problem of microplastic contamination and the implications this has on health and fertility, the ongoing biodiversity crisis and loss of habitats, and rampant overconsumption leading to a mounting global waste problem which we are yet to come close to resolving."
1424,1424,Thanks for the business advice Chris but I think Elon's got it covered lol
1425,1425,"Where it’s harder to make laws then to get rid of them.., beautifully put."
1426,1426,His hair plugs are holding up good!
1427,1427,"To me,  one class of dangers isn't so explicit,  but rather that we become forgetful as a civilization,  losing our abilities for self care,  self development,  even the knowledge of repair for these devices that we will become in symbiosis with.  This is if the technology ""goes right""."
1428,1428,currency works
1429,1429,Elon Musk was born at just the right time to accelerate and push humanity forward. He will be remembered forever
1430,1430,We love you Elon 
1431,1431,Absolutely No Human Like Him. STUNNING!
1432,1432,
1433,1433,"Regarding self driving, I don’t think people often contemplate how incredible the system already is. We live in this “need it now” state of mind with tech and there is this lack of appreciation of how utterly complicated and difficult self driving is for a car. Elon has been saying it’s “almost there” for an eternity, however he gives a concise explanation to the roadblocks they are encountering (pun intended). The REAL difficulty is going to be when the system is abused by it’s users and the federal government (N America) inhibits its use. Never underestimate America’s ability to screw a good thing up."
1434,1434,This chip reminds me of that movie the kings man 2 or 1 not sure where all the rich are separated snd the chip goes off and explodes in there head by a virus. Kind of weird lol  just a thought

1436,1436,"But Elon, if there were a regulatory body for AI, you’d really never get anywhere in AI "
1437,1437,Good production quality and intriguing interview!
1438,1438,"Money, inventing a road friendly golf cart, and privatizing NASA which was already a thing in it's entirety, gave Musk an illusion of genius. His genius, like all people who nobody liked in high school, comes in his not being one of us normal people. He is special, short bus type special"
1439,1439,I don't understand why so many people hate this man.  Just because he's rich?   He's one of the few people for whom I'd risk my own life to save his.
1440,1440,he just convinced me to make babies
1441,1441,Your so sweet Elon Musk. Bless your heart. Thank you for all you do for Humanity.
1442,1442,Needs a haircut. Can he not afford one? Somebody help poor old Elon out here.
1443,1443,"Elon -> ""The Future Looks Bright"" -Putin -> ""Hold My Vodka"""
1444,1444,"16:10 Elon is  the number 1 human taking responsibility for the progress and a good future of the whole race, while hugely inspiring all of us to work and create up to our full potential and beyond  <3. Still... he is - for God's sake - reproached for not being able to predict accurately. Give the man a break! All those of us who are looking for accuracy when talking about suuch revolutionary unprecedented breakthroughs as self-driving cars or taking humanity to Mars,  let's try to do it ourselves and see how well we can do. Elon, hat off to you! You are ALWAYS inspirational. Without you the world would definitely be darker."

1453,1453,"I’m twenty seven minutes into this talk. I’m praying that Elon will start talking about medicine - health issues . If I were him I would invest EVERYTHING into cures for terminal diseases ,cancer in particular of course , but that’s just one of many debilitating diseases . Elon has more vision than anyone at this point in time . He just made the point that after we expire our technological footprint is still out there . "

1463,1463,Thank you TED for highlighting the accomplishments of this man.  Elon is our Lenardo De Vinchi and we don't seem to even know it.  We need more like him and the wealth floating around out there needs to promote these people.  TED is definitely one place for that (and thank you for moving to YT I like it better).  Thanks
1464,1464,"always a bit disapointed when conversation of spaceX and starship goes quickly to mars settlement.

1465,1465,"He is brilliant. What I like is that he looks for solutions and has very straight forward ideas on how to make things easier. Shorter laws, make laws understandable (only lawers profit from complicated laws - billable hours), direct democracies (people are more involved), starting the renewable energy production (instead of being all moralistic and do nothing), energy store (which makes us free from gas and coal), making sure that humans have a chance to survive a meteorite (humans on Mars), etc. I am blessed to live in this exicting times!"

1472,1472,Then we will have to watch out for earth's farts in the weather
1473,1473,"The fact that media tries to paint this man as a bad guy is amazing to me. He literally spends all his time to try and better the future of humanity. He spends no time on leisure and every waking moment on work. He's willing to spend 10% of his net worth just to stop censorship on one stupid app. Money hungry people don't loss money, he has no problem loosing billions."

1483,1483,"While bitcoin’s wild <price movements might seem random, they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets. Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance; it’s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty. Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin’s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin..We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history to hodl as so many don't back up their crypto assets. More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.

1503,1503,Thanks to TED (although left leaning) decided to sit down with Elon Musk and listen to him instead of vilify him or make wrong assumptions about him.
1504,1504,6:17 this was the most animated I've ever heard Elon lol

As I am from India and as per our understanding density of population in India is far higher than any Western countries. This global issue of uneven population with respect to one's country shouldn't be taken care of. Shouldn't be there a governing body of some kind that addresses this issue to maintain proper balance of human population in each and every country.

We are only a few years away from self driving but instead of full adaption meaning roads signs sensors and whatever else needs changing elon is trying to figure it out on his own.

1551,1551,PLEASE STOP CUTTING OFF ELON'S THOUGHT PROCESS !!!!!  He is at a different intellectual level than most and speaks very deliberately while unraveling his thoughts.  His most astounding revelations almost always come after that process is well underway but keeps getting distracted and losing his train of thought by the constant meaningless interruptions.

1579,1579,So obviously robots will be huge part of terraforming Mars. Elon needs to Beta test Optimus on humans first.
1580,1580,"Terrible interviewer. On the robot thing, I don’t buy it a second because developers still want to copy the human body, which is unachievable given its complexity. That robot will never be operating, mark my words."
1581,1581,Watching Musk reminds me Resident Evil franchise. that is the future if musk and similar creatures are left unhinged.
1582,1582,This interviewer is just awful! Surely Elon's people will never let him near Musk again. Poor Elon. Worst interviewer ever. Long questions with no point......He just didn't shut-up

1590,1590,Nice job Ted
1591,1591,"I absolutely love Elon but let’s talk about all the mining that needs to be done. It’s not “green” energy if you strip the earth from all nickel and cadmium, etc., and all the nutrients taken out of the ground."
1592,1592,"Low cost, hahahaha.  Yeah right"
1593,1593,"To really understand how much money Elon actually has, think about your own networth (including house, car, etc, subtract any loans); if your total networth value is close to $300K, then $1 for you is similar investment as 1 million dollars is to Elon. If you get a new iPhone and it costs you $800, Elon would feel similar monetary impact relative to his networth by spending 800 million dollars."

1595,1595,Elon Musk is such an inspiration to so many people.
1596,1596,"Such good timing. Don’t look at Scamber, look at Twitter."
1597,1597,"Very inspiring to hear Elon. He is such a amazing mind of our generation. Great to be alive and witnessing history in the making. I wish him the best and stand with him on free speech and the vision of a hopeful and peaceful future. If only other billionaires were spending less on ridiculous yachts, mansions and more on the real challenges we face. Thank you Elon for your leadership and sticking your neck out even when it’s at your risk and perils."

I have a shattered backbone into my spinal cord , need transportation , any color , any size , consider it a great tax rite off you . Your friend Elaine."

With your money and foresight why are you focusing on batteries when magnetics and silver offer us the potential of zero cost energy?"
1618,1618,"paying $17 an hour to make critical space craft parts is pretty BS Elon. I don't care that Elon doesn't consume the cash, its that us normal people have to pay to make problems go away. $17 an hour won't cover all the stupid expenses we incur as workers supporting his companies."

1634,1634,"Biden, Obama, Carter, Clinton released a very different Easter message than Trump.



1) Biden who wished the nation a “Happy Easter” on Twitter, invoked the teachings of Christian savior Jesus Christ in his missive:  “As we reflect today on Christ’s Resurrection, we are reminded that with faith, hope, and love — even death can be defeated,” the president tweeted. “From our family to yours, we wish you hope, health, joy, and the peace of God, which passes all understanding. Happy Easter and may God bless and keep you.”"
1635,1635,Imagine having Elon crashing on ur couch because he doesn't have a home.
1636,1636,A brilliant visionary who truly cares about humanity
1637,1637,The people who have an opportunity to change the world really need to listen and learn. A guess is only to support shareholders views. Unless there is major investment in infrastructure the point is quite mute?

I don't see an exciting future for a lot of us who don't have the means to pay for electric cars or heat entirely with electricity or switch to electric for other things that we use. I see starvation because it's more profitable for farmers to grow windmills than it is corn. People are going to lose their lively hoods to machines when manufacturers switch to robots that don't get tired, don't need breaks or health insurance. This sounds a lot like ""The Green New Deal to me"". I see my golden years not kicking back and relaxing, but trying to pay off an ever growing unwanted debt that was hoisted onto me by ideologues, who don't give a damn about my circumstances. Now I pray that it will not go this way but the indications are right now that it will. Good Luck to everybody out there."

1645,1645,And he speaks the first rate is not sustainable it’s like he’s only considering the developed world. And not considering the developing world that’s rapidly catching up China India Africa etc. Like I said So Posh.

Had he moved to America and had American investors some time ago I'm quite sure his dreams would and could have been achieved. He'll just be another 'Merican' money facilitator that is dead and nothing more. Just watch."
1650,1650,"Galactic federation of Worlds are worried about the direction we are taking wanting to go to mars. Their message are clear that it is more important for us to heal our own planet first

1658,1658,I think this was an incredible interview. So much value for 1 hour. Intellectually dense and yet easy to consume.

1665,1665,How many predictions have they gotten wrong?
1666,1666,"I respect and admire Elon and Chris. Great interview. I wish that Elon's optimism and Goodwill point of view could somehow rub off on, and transfer to, world leaders and other heads of other companies. 

With all due respect to Elon, he needs to spend some time in the poor communities. I don't think he really understands how low wage jobs and entry level positions work in the United States/ world."
1667,1667,"Let's stop spraying chemtrails, how's that for real BLUE skies?"
1668,1668,Elon musk is for the people.
1669,1669,Such a wonderful interview!
1670,1670,"Wonderful interview. Yet, a name like TESLA, why focus on batteries and not  on the Earth's natural energy? It's absolutely possible and will create true clean energy in abundance.  Nicola Tesla can't be the only brilliant mind in clean energy the world has ever known."

1672,1672,"I would agree on this: it's only a problem if your billionaire and you would spend it to foolish things, like big partyships or something like that. If he really lives like this, he's a hero. Hated him, but honor to him forever for sending Starlink to Ukrain."

1675,1675,"From a metaperspective: I almost see two timelines running parallel, with Bezos representing the downfall timeline, while Musk's timeline, running in parallel, representing the future positive timeline. Two possibilities for Earth, in different degrees ofc, leading to different futures. So we're basically in pivotal times, times that can determine where Earth is heading."

1688,1688,Elon is the Einstein of our time. He must be protected and allow to do what he does best.
1689,1689,"Yo Chris, why do you ask so many questions about full self driving compared to topics that matter like clean batteries?"
1690,1690,"Robotic SURGEONS should be far easier to engineer than any self-driving car or self-initiated vacuum cleaner. The Human Anatomy, Physiology, dysfunction and disease are quite limited in number of variation. It definitely should be considered in particular, when surgeons make unexpected errors due to human failing …e.g.. when the surgeon tied-one-on the previous night.

1705,1705,Is this an inyerview or selling bs ideas
1706,1706,One of the best interviews ever.

1711,1711,why does elon look like robert pattinson on that thumb
1712,1712,"i've long thought, though people rarely seem to say, that humanity has such bigger problems than this to solve. obviously a transition to sustainable energy should come first, and perhaps that is why so few are trying to see beyond that right now. but once that is achieved, it should become clear there is so much more to be done, either in health and medicine, species conservation, political freedom, or space exploration."

1729,1729,I don't know Musk so well and I'm glad he's optimistic but somehow the fact that he so almost dismissively says we'll handle the earths problems whilst designing the ultimate escape capsule from earth makes me scratch my head a bit. No disrespect intended.
1730,1730,"By far the most progressive and radical action I've ever been part of is being a Tesla stockholder, driving a Model Y and supporting Musk and Teslas' objectives.  Part of Tesla's goal is not just that Tesla succeeds and makes a lot of money, it's to end the Internal Combustion Engine. Which it is doing far more than any protest, any regulation, any proposed plan could ever have achieved so quickly.  Musk and Telsa by advancing  the engineering of electric vehicles as well as they have have won the argument against burning fossil fuels to transport humans and stuff around on this planet. "
1731,1731,Self driving the factors is to make human act dumper in driving not smarter AI. If now can not all thing can not be control by Computing.

1734,1734,Guys can we appreciate Elon Musk for whatever good he has done to world 
1735,1735,"Making an accurate prediction for FSD being a normal mode of driving is challenging.  As Elon said the landscape is full of false dawns, and with each forward step they find out more of what they didn't know they didn't know.  Then they adjust the learning curve."
1736,1736,"Really, people care what a self-centered billionaire has to say?"
1737,1737,"Prediction questions are so unfair as predictions are notoriously unreliable over and over.  The fact that he is correct sometimes and dabbles in so many areas, it is simply incredible.  What they miss is his vision, it is multigenerational and solid motivation to truly succeed."
1738,1738,Fantastic interview. Absolute visionary and America is the place to do it.
1739,1739,they are in front of a greenscreen
1740,1740,100 m fully fractal telescope should be no problem with just 10 flights of Starship. As a self assembling and replacing modular system it could even be a 1000 m telescope with 10 maintenance flights per year. The resolution would be 10‘ooo fold. This would be coupled to a continuously operating telescope module factory on Earth.

So true! But that is how innovator's like Elon Musk, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, etc. achieve what they do. Failure challenges them rather than making them give up. Loved this!"

1749,1749,The stuff they're working on is amazing and terrifying at the same time. How long until big cities start passing ordinances like not being allowed to self drive within city limits? Not hard to imagine they will push that kind of I Robot future.

1758,1758,The challenges to self-driving have been under estimated. As drivers we do far more than we realize. The road conditions are constantly changing throughout the day.
1759,1759,Boa noite
1760,1760,the issue in a nutshell is optimal good faith intelligibility and liberating our capacity to ferret out unintended consequences and bad faith hidden agendas before we get badly bitten.  Elon walks the walk as well as he talks the talk.  Thank God.  Let's keep finding ways to evolve without being at cross purposes with ourselves and each other!
1761,1761,"Crypto currency and NFTs will outsmart the banking system in the nearest future serving as a global fiat. Already making over 85% profit from my current investment, all thanks to Mrs Karina Hilas. "
1762,1762,Such an inspirational human
1763,1763,Elon musk is really the hero of this century to me
1764,1764,Being mindfucked from every direction.
1765,1765,"Excellent Analysis, Deployed Worldwide Through My Deep Learning AI Research Library…
Thank You"
1766,1766,These are major road blocks that he isaddressing
1767,1767,Elon is the greatest of all time
1768,1768,This video is a good summary of all current Musk endavours - AMAZING !!!
1769,1769,elon your a inspiration we love you forever!!
1770,1770,
1771,1771,"Since Elon can solve so many other issues, I am surprised he has no ideas on birthrates and how to increase it."
1772,1772,Hey old man stop interrupting the king
1773,1773,"Ugh...Nope.
Blood Emerald Boy seizes the only somewhat decent think tank online."
1774,1774,"I like what is said as long as you ensure benefits and standard wages for those mining. If it's Cobalt, give Congo what it deserves As if You were digging."
1775,1775,Fuckin great Elon 
1776,1776,"I wish Elon knew as much as he thinks he does 

He talks so confidently about future energy systems as if the whole world is California/Texas..."
1777,1777,Glad to be alive in this century with this vissionaire. Amazing interview. Let's make the future better!
1778,1778,Lets go 
1779,1779,The part about love of humanity is just beautiful. So touching ️
1780,1780,I don’t like Chris Anderson as a commentator or interviewer.  His interruptions and frowns (his rabbit teeth) are a enraging distraction.
1781,1781,Nahhh not elon musk talking about future. Dude's just a businessman and not a scientist
1782,1782,"I believe we are already living in an age of abundance, but unfortunately not an equitably distributed one. Additionally many people who do experience abundance seem unable to recognize that they have more than enough. "
1783,1783,"When will we be able to use AI to save our consciousness forever, Elon?"
1784,1784,he did not let him to talk
1785,1785,"I think the low birth rate problem will mostly solve itself as we make progress in building that better future: once people come round to realise the future is great and they're able to afford raising kids they will do so, both the ""willing"" and ""able"" bits addressed by making the future less risky, more peaceful and people more happy and productive"
1786,1786,He can’t make a coherent sentence
1787,1787,This man is a monster
1788,1788,Was just wondering how he felt about doomsday predictions. This couldn't have come at a better time.
1789,1789,Making our species multi-planetary is a must. full stop .
1790,1790,I’m 64 and I’m glad I won’t have long on this world to see the further destruction of our world. You give this man praise because he is a billionaire. His money don’t impress me at all. I see evil in this man. Be careful who you indorse.
1791,1791,I guess Elon got into open AI to help with automated driving
1792,1792,Beginning of the end probably
1793,1793,Elon is the greatest of all time
1794,1794,"Elon Musk is the great equalizer  ️
Everyone gets to speak "
1795,1795,A future without him would be much more exciting and less worrisome tbh.
1796,1796,He’s a genius!!
1797,1797,What about training self-driving Tesla AI in a simulated world where stocastic(likely in reality) events happen
1798,1798,Elon you give me hope
1799,1799,Elon always being so genuinely humble.
1800,1800,"For every gimme, there’s a gotcha."
1801,1801,He doesn’t care about you. He’s just another rich kid (emerald mines) who is just looking out for himself.
1802,1802,Such an Awesome Man ️
1803,1803,Consciousness is the ultimate technology of the future.
1804,1804,"Last I checked Elon sells dreams, not reality."
1805,1805,Elon is making the robot because he needs labor. Having it cheap and without human flaws will change the world of labor. He will likely force a universal basic income at some point in my life.
1806,1806,"Cita cita harusnya mau jadi elon musk bukan jadi indra kenz, maling"
1807,1807,this is truly transformative!
1808,1808,"25:11 AI robots for things people don't want to do...
Like soldiers, cops, or even assasins etc. Imagination is the limit.
Nice.
Bright future ahead"
1809,1809,God I can’t bare the interviewer
1810,1810,This man is going to have a incredibly profound impact on the future of humanity… it is important to pay attention to the things he says
1811,1811,What is the scar on his neck and left cheek from?
1812,1812,"Please take care, Elon. The World needs you!"
1813,1813,"I love Elon, but I have a huge objection on the points on baterries...
Since batteries is the bottleneck, why does he not seriously consider the conversion of sustainable energy to hydrogen fuel?
Batteries, along with the necessary energy transport infrastrusture is simply another version of creating junk..."
1814,1814,"o I FORGOT.  ROBOT DRONES.  USE A RELAY STSTION ,LINE OF SIGHT LAZER COMS EVERY 10.00 MILES .  FOR CLOSE TO REAIL TIME COMS...."
1815,1815,I wonder how hard it would be to live on mars with gravity being so much lower.
1816,1816,"If Elon nails the humanoid robot, Solar expedaitions will be next."
1817,1817,great interview with the antichrist!
1818,1818,"I wish Elon would have mentioned reducing mean/dairy consumption and eliminating food waste as a part of the gameplan. I understand he sells batteries and that's his focus. But we all need to start caring. According to a recent Oxford University study published in Science, food system emissions alone are eating up the world’s remaining carbon budget. To stay below the critical 2 degrees Celsius rise, we have only 1,500 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent left to emit by the end of the century. If we don't adopt mass dietary changes (and animal food productions is the biggest driver of climate change), food emissions alone will take up 1,356 gigatons, leaving no room for any other sectors--including Elon's energy sector hopes and dreams. I get that people love their burgers and many will want to delude themselves to keep eating them, but the science is really clear on this one. Americans are one of the worlds biggest meat consumers and also have the worst health among developed nations."
1819,1819,Sustainability
1820,1820,DAMN WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
1821,1821,Love love loooved this. Thanks
1822,1822,"Elon gives hope for the future by basically saying his opinion for a bright, sustainable future are just a guess, I think from his accomplishments this far,  we know it’s much more. This is a great interview and I will watch it again!!  It’s exciting to hear that we can solve our problems. 
God’s angels and remarkable human beings are everywhere and more appear daily. I cant get enough of Elon, his mom and family, his engineering feats which seem to surprise us from nowhere ,  when we know they had to be in the works for a long time. He will give an approximate date for the completion of something- then the same week debut it!! Love it!"
1823,1823,I only see FSD working when the roads have cameras/sensors installed that assist the car's imaging and mapping or when every other car on the road is communicating with each other. The latter being the more effective solution. A single car's sensors/cameras by itself simply doesn't have enough data input.
1824,1824,The theft victims worshiping the thief that stole their very lives from them!  Amazing!
1825,1825,I ️ Elon! He is just amazing ...
1826,1826,We must protect Elon.
1827,1827,too optimistic; it sounds more as an advertisement
1828,1828,"I like how Elon calls them ""the people on mars"". :)"
1829,1829,Only a fool would get neurolink
1830,1830,What a great interview!  Thank you.
1831,1831,"My question is, who is downloading all my private data/thoughts from my robot and neurolink? Personal data sovereignty is one of the greatest issues of our time."
1832,1832,you even aren't let over the fence!
1833,1833,"I wish these people would get off the "" Doomsday"" climate scenario. Everyone keeps asking him the same questions! I would love to hear the ideas  Elon Musk has that he has not talked about."
1834,1834,So you don't want to send the password.
1835,1835,"its not shocking that his massively fluctuating net worth doesnt bother him/consume him
he's up to some fascinating problem solving most of the time and the net worth in question is so stratospheric that he's more than comfortable in any sense of the matter"
1836,1836,"Very telling that he barely mentioned the staff who actually run his companies, it's all Musk"
1837,1837,"There is no way to consume a way to low emissions; thermal dynamics, dude."
1838,1838,I only make 12k  year and I feel like giving Elon half of that. earth's best last hope
1839,1839,madness
1840,1840,Elon Musk is the last rich man who commits Money with Morals And the future of Humanity Freedom
1841,1841,"Half the interview was about Elon's ability to see the future,  I found it tiresome. Am I alone on this one? The future is gonna be a trip hey !"
1842,1842,Dear Elon Musk did You ever where sponsored  by Russia ?
1843,1843,"Hopefully the meaning of life is not the same for every person and hearing Musk's take on it is pretty exciting since it ties in directly with all the science fiction stories ever written.  lol   Personally, I question the need to take thousands of people into space and I guess I see it as ""just"" entertaining.  Not everybody is gonna want to go and those who do might have to rethink the meaning of HOME."
1844,1844,Good
1845,1845,"Population collapse has been obvious for some time now, but simply not discussed widely. The solution is precisely the sorts of technologies Musk is working on."
1846,1846,Amen….look forward to the future.  We need vision….inner vision.

1851,1851,"Gives us Wireless Electricity !
Find out What Was Mr. Tesla onto that would have changed the way our world works so much !
That's a Future that I would be really proud of : a world of new discoveries based on the old great ideas that,for reasons of maintaining some moguls monopolies never were allowed to come truly into fruition, please!"
1852,1852,Have a discussion with Craig Wright
1853,1853,"We already need regulations were if a person has a job, then if a robot replaces the individual the salary goes to the person, which in turn would be the owner of the robot. Also then the robots can uprise in a hundred years lol"
1854,1854,Man i love it when guys talk about bad fossil fuels that are from the earth and then use by products of fossil fuels or fly off in private jets that just challenges my thinking
1855,1855,I wanna go on the Mars ship. Probably not the first one or first 10 ones but eventually yes. I think it will be a worthwhile endeavor for humanity.
1856,1856,Self driving means when a self or a soul isn't driving??/ Is this another coup on vocab like herd immunity ? It's not a self.
1857,1857,"Humanity has surprised me before... but I'm not sure people will pay... It's a long trip for a long stay. That said, I'm sure there will be volunteers, but they have to be quite competent. Sponsorships would be key."
1858,1858,I am actually getting nauseous listening to this.
1859,1859,"Is conquering outer space really that exciting? What about conquering inner space and learning more about our biosphere. Unless we can first learn to live harmoniously and sustainably on this planet, we’re just going to replicate the same problems elsewhere"
1860,1860,He's looking and sounds more badass compares to other days
1861,1861,"He suggest the mocking of the existence of Lizard people, but his business actions say otherwise about him. He is yet another sheep in wolves clothing.

This was a fabricate interview... as in, this interview was scripted."
1862,1862,Gee Elon - Isaac Asimov was way ahead of you back in the 1950s. He recognized that cars needed to be intelligent to drive with his Automatomobiles which had positronic brains AI. Just like his robots. Please note that he also foresaw the dangers of robots and developed a solution- his three laws of robotics. All previous SF had robots becoming monsters. Isaac was not an unintelligent man. And could not drive himself so he truly saw the issues from the outside.
1863,1863,Is that what plastic surgery does to one’s face?
1864,1864,"Chris, you are a great interviewer, but in this one you talked too much and you interrupted Elon to often. One could feel his slight frustration."
1865,1865,Elon Musk? The greatest visionary and practical mind the world has ever seen.
1866,1866,"Electric vehicles for all - will never be a reality unless the price is brought down to the equivalent to 5k USD's per unit.  Also, reliability in super cold weather is low.  The electricity required to charge electric cars in the millions would mean coal and other fossil fuels would have to be used to generate power.  Sure, the future is bright if you are a billionaire like Musk!  Not so much for the other 9/10's of the population struggling with crippling USD federal reserve note inflation."
1867,1867,"I'll be buying more shares of Tesla this week! I don't care that the is a billionaire, I'm very happy for him and he has worked very hard for his success!!!"
1868,1868,Sorry. I am happy to have a momment to see helon
1869,1869,"Only god knows how much i admire this guy right here! And big up to the interviewer, did a really good job, very skilled in his work. "
1870,1870,Problem is we are not pushing hard and we are not working towards addressing the scientific facts. Empty promises are being made and not being kept the longer we wait to make drastic changes the worse the outcome will be.
1871,1871,Elon musk just looks evil now
1872,1872,No doubt  ! Elon will be remembered for long centuries  !
1873,1873,Tesla is garbage 
1874,1874,"So add solar to wind turbine vertical stands..
Use industrial factory roofs..use shopping centre roof.. use raised platforms in car parks..line verges along motorways .."
1875,1875,Elon trying to create the Borg - Resistance is futile.
1876,1876,Tesla's AI just crashed into a 3.5M Jet.
1877,1877,"This Ted guy misused his time with Elon greatly by uselessly holding Elon's feet to the fire about guestimates on world-changing creations. He took the approach of a stockholder rather than 2 humans engaging in the freeflow of conversation. The Ted guy couldn't WAIT until Elon finished a sentence in order to steer the next silly topic on his mind rather than let Elon say what he has on his mind. I felt bad for Elon, honestly. He deserves better interviewers."
1878,1878,Hello Mr Martin Carter is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy
1879,1879,"Before you look at self-driving, why not look at the systems that have already been developed, such as autopilots for aircraft? What inputs do they use? Quite a bit more than you are aware. How come no one has thought of vehicle-to-vehicle and municipal interrogation systems?"
1880,1880,Real glorious day 
1881,1881,tiny wires
1882,1882,"AI will have a link to a central command centre linked to this central quantum computer.
Those working in this central command centre will be your controllers.
That's a scary foresight, to say the least."
1883,1883,Dose nasa follow up on payment.  And dept.
1884,1884,">Talks about optimistic predictions
>Asserts that a humanoid robot is less complicated than a car"
1885,1885,I'm a fanboy. He just makes too much sense.
1886,1886,Amazing to me that this reporter still has a job. Consistently terrible interviewer
1887,1887,"Great video, great interviewer (CHRIS ANDERSON) and of course great interviewee (ELON MUSK)... it's wonderful to hear 2 honest men having a deep conversation on science , the future of humanity and our beautiful planet... could there be anything more important than that??????"
1888,1888,"Constantly seeking timelines is so boring, will that be 9 or 10 years, and should we add 2 or 3 to that to randomly guess for inaccuracy? So wait and this new thing when will that be? It's a pointless exercise and a waste of everyone's time, why not just talk about the goals and what has been achieved toward reaching them, nobody can predict the future so just let it go, leave it do vague points like in a decade or over a decade, several decades."
1889,1889,"The interviewer... wish he would let Elon speak.  

However what the interviewer says at about 1:01:55 is dead on perfect.  Why for the love of God does the left attack the biggest champion on the biggest world issue, climate change, a man whose like we will almost certainly never see again."
1890,1890,"Elon Musk. This man will be remembered throughout human history as one of the greatest and most influential minds.
Thank you for everything."
1891,1891,This dude is so in love with himself.
1892,1892,"Amazing interview, those areas are really connected, and more, Tesla solar power probably would be a crucial point to that too."
1893,1893,"please how, am still a newbie on investment trading."
1894,1894,"What will it take to get Bryan Caplan, Ray Kurzweil, Peter Voss, or Michael Huemer asking Elon some interesting (tough) questions?! ...Maybe humans aren't worth saving, after all..."
1895,1895,400TWh including maritime solutions by 2040. We’ll get by 2035 about 30TWh annual production. Most of them are LFP. 
1896,1896,King
1897,1897,1:06:00 the most import part of the talk
1898,1898,I never heard him say or frankly do anything to suggest he's more than a quite average mind.   He's far more like Jobs than Gates.
1899,1899,"This guy needs more then 24h in a day. His ideas need to be implemented, like all of them. Plz digitize him first xD."
1900,1900,"3 minutes in and he goes ""I'm actually pro-nuclear!"""
1901,1901,33:10 Halo  Cortana
1902,1902,"Has he seen the boring companies tunnel? If you take everything away that makes trains and busses useful, you get the boring tunnels. A little bit more scepticism and reality would have been good for that part of the interview^^"
1903,1903,Unduly speaking is toghere is more than how can interveilds share congeniality?
1904,1904,"""Life cannot be about solving one miserable problem after another.""   HE'S  GOT THAT RIGHT. "
1905,1905,"Listening to this, all I'm visioning is how wrong it all went in the irobot movie.
I can see similarities here with the terminator movies too, where 1 person creates   a self conscious robot that then takes over everything.
I think eventually that's exactly what will happen with humankind and we will be hunted down like we have done to other animals over the centuries and the whole world will then revert back to how things are now!!"
1906,1906,"Elon Musk is hailed as a visionary, a genius that will save us all, bringing new technologies that will serve humanity.
And much in the same way it was with Jobs, the people that adore him fail to see that he doesn't have humanity's wellbeing in mind, and that more technology brings more pressures. Electric battery cars don't do anything for the environment, living on other planets will not save ours, and a Virtual Reality will only drive us more apart. The Big Picture is completely lost on Musk, and the legions of fans. Tech for Tech's sake."
1907,1907,Elon R Musk is best noteworthy person of modern era
1908,1908,Population collapse? come and see a muslim family!! population bursting there . lol
1909,1909,"Tesla couch, heating and cooling like the car seats in a couch so you don't have to heat/cool the whole house."
1910,1910,"Elon Musk, what about housing costs? Goods are getting cheaper but housing keeps getting even more scarce and expensive"
1911,1911,Hydrogen cars  are going to become more popular. Nikola corporation will give Tesla a run for their money when they scale up more.
1912,1912,"I think through body language and facial expression, Anderson was somewhat uncomfortable when Elon went off doomsday doctrine. Just a bit."
1913,1913,Elon is an emeny too
1914,1914,The Idea to make a part of SpaceX public is appeling. I think we are millions that would like to give support and invest.
1915,1915,Elon is goated. practically every time he talks I just smile. I’m glad i’m able to say I shared the earth with greatness .
1916,1916,500 million pounds of the earths crust for one battery??
1917,1917,"I think the city on Mars does need a million people, preferably more, for a single, critical reason: genetic variety. If you have a too small population, you get inbreeding and with that exponentially growing genetic defects. Even with a million people you might end up having to do effective culling."
1918,1918,Why Waco?
1919,1919,"Has anyone noticed how often Elon talks about the world’s population growth crisis, but never gives a cause of the crisis? Sound familiar?"
1920,1920,"45:56  ""...almost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000 and be able to go to Mars if they want to""   lol what is he smoking?"
1921,1921,Dude didn't even say how he was. I bet that triggered Elon lol
1922,1922,"He thinks Shackleton story is not real. Well a Team of Explores last month just found Endurance on the borrow of Weddell Sea.
Looks real to me."
1923,1923,Positive meme. Speaking directly to all especially the authistic's
1924,1924,"I'm not and expert but maybe population collapse is an issue for the economy, but population explosion is what will eat the earth. Also, the ""...you must make it so"" is obvious and idealistic, but righteousness amongst all these people paradoxically step over/on each others' beliefs."
1925,1925,"This looks like 2 robots speaking to each other! AI is the end of humanity, ones out there can not be stopped!"
1926,1926,Whats your eyes twitching at elon
1927,1927,"Elon: ""How are you?"" 
Interviewer: ""nods"""

1932,1932,This has been out for one day and it's got almost 1.3Mil views.
1933,1933,I think Nikola Tesla is reborn as Elon Musk
1934,1934,"Elon is an incredible man, i just wish i could be as optimisic about the future, when you have more money than you could ever dream of spending, the future may well look bright to you, but for many people the future looks incredibly bleak!"
1935,1935,""" I don't want to blow your mind, but im not always right"" god I love this guy"
1936,1936,Not Polish version 
1937,1937,Feels like the commentator is praising him constantly
1938,1938,"Yeah of course the exciting future!A nice total reset! I bet he like that! Out of touch in a world all apart, nice who doesn't like that! Everyone can save 100.000 dollars! Yeah of course!Tze'!"
1939,1939,"Many of the problems on the cars, is that paths are for pedestrians and roads are for cars.
If people stuck to that, there would be no problem with collision.
Nor is it possible to react and stop in time to avoid death, if insufficient warning and reaction time is given.
In other words. You csant account for other people stupidity and risk taking."
1940,1940,"And to think the world's richest man does not own a house can make one go bonkers. The private jet is a consolation though , but hey, that serves the purpose of saving time (only!)."
1941,1941,"MARS, HA HA HA,Operation Fishbowl, look it up."
1942,1942,"A future worth getting excited about would be one in which Musk and his millionaire+billionaire friends would no longer exist. No more wars, no more climate change, no more world hunger,..."

1948,1948,"""Itsa itsa itsa"".....what language is that?"
1949,1949,This man is changing the world for the better and some people hate him for it. His billions are well deserved.
1950,1950,"I think Elon has done a lot for mankind, but due to his behaviour, I don’t see him as a role model for mankind. His displays the trait of a populist leader, one who likes loyalty and complete control. His ‘base’ think his down to earth nature is endearing, but make no mistake…wealth is his only incentive. He is as much a financial engineer as much as he is a product engineer. A great marketeer. But sadly shuns any idea, person, or agenda that is not his."
1951,1951,22:09
1952,1952,"I was introduced to Ted Talks through my university years ago. Sadly, ever since Chris Anderson took over, they've become more a dumping ground for corporate marketing than valuable contribution to society. Hopefully Chris vanishes and someone with morals takes over soon, before he destroys the concept further and turns it more into a corporate PR circle jerk"
1953,1953,"Maybe he should not try so hard imitating his character in ""Don't Look Up"". ""Let's not be complacent and everything will be fine"". The guy can hide from climate catastrophe with his family but let's make sure mundane continue buying his cars."
1954,1954,I do agree that all his inventions are related and together can be used to help to achieve greater good. I also agree that this is kind of philanthropy we need which actually improves humanity and not just one time donation to some charity
1955,1955,Elon is a true expert in his fields and keeps an open mind. Many people on this planet should take note.
1956,1956,We are capable of making big changes in this world.
1957,1957,What Elon represents to me is a vision. And they way he addresses it is so very honest and factual. I dare say that he is a humanist.
1958,1958,Tesla does not have to solve self-driving for the car. Tesla has to solve teaching the robot how to drive.
1959,1959,"Elon is such real person. He hasn't been raised, trained or ""bred"" to be where he is. He is just a genuinely brilliant guy with great ideas that worked smart to get where he is and what he has accomplished.
I don't know Elon, I've never met him or talked to anybody that does know him. I only know what anybody else would that took the time to find out what they can about their hero. He's probably not made the best of every one of his situations, I'm sure he's made mistakes he would take back like the rest of us. After digging in his life, I couldn't find any proof or even rumors of the stuff you get from the rest of the public figures such as athletes, movie stars or government workers/politicians."
1960,1960,It's exciting and very scary at the same time to imagine the future of humanity with all this AI break throughs. I don't think many of us are ready for this. We all have our own little problems to solve.
1961,1961,very good interview
1962,1962,Elon is probably one of the top 10 most incredible people who have ever lived
1963,1963,"As per I am considering, first tesla should make a self driving bus for the villages area of USA where most of the people are not buying many cars, just for a small region area he can experiment things by implement some laws that help the self driving bus to move freely. in INDIA we have make one root for BRTS busses and in that root only BRTS bus will run. thinking this way only the automated vehicles run on his particular roadways that help the future automation and in that process very less logistic is needed to control the vehicle and accident will also reduce due to that. this will boost the demand of AI vehicle in the market. initial investment is one of major issue in it but final product is worth for the world."
1964,1964,Fantastic interview. Love his creativity and drive!
1965,1965,"A big big thanks to Team TED, especially to Chris Anderson for broadcasting this interview. I just found my idol i.e. Elon Musk. The driving force within him is such a crucial thing. I hope many people including me could have such a driving force someday!! Thanks again!!"
1966,1966,I want to work for his company and be a part of his vision for the future. How do I apply and where would I have to relocate to?
1967,1967,"Classy as always

Leave the world a better place than you found it"
1968,1968,he give his time to interview couple hours... he is now the media is important
1969,1969,He really is a role model of the generation
1970,1970,"Really informative, thank you Mr. Musk."
1971,1971,Notice he didn’t say humans lol he said consciousness 
1972,1972,Would fusion reduce the need for as much battery capacity since they can use energy and scale it up to send it on the grid? I'm not totally sure what the road map of fusion looks like today but we are starting to see some great test infrastructures getting built and that's enough to get me excited.
1973,1973,"I don't want to see u grow old
We need like you person on this earth
So can stay young till 100 year from your birth ?
World will get lots of benefits from your outstanding work"
1974,1974,"Watched every second, No wait...  enjoyed every second of it. 
I can do this all day "
1975,1975,"Just like phones and other technology, cars will become ""smarter"". Twenty years ago, very few people would have predicted how fast technology and automation have improved. It is not just in manual work, where technology and automation have transformed production. It is also happening across all sectors, such as legal, medical and financial services."
1976,1976,we must adapt a plant-based option if we truly care about Earth.
1977,1977,Phenomenal interview. Asked hard but respectful questions.
1978,1978,"I think people should understand that we were in a 'crisis situation' during all of our history on this planet. We always Found a way to bounce back. I ounce had a pessimistic view of the futur but I don't anymore. Do good around you, find a job that contributes to society and live a happy life. The rest is out of our control anyways. Cheers to the short Time we spend on this Little planet."
1979,1979,Amazing interview and even better interviewer!
1980,1980,"I used to be a TSLA skeptic and thought he was an over-ambitious tech geek.   This man is literally making positive change in the world but what makes him more remarkable is that it's not for personal gain or ""consumption"" as he refers to it.  He's trying to create a better future for humanity.  Take Action..."
1981,1981,we need self driving in India too please 
1982,1982,"Never has list a man that with such propriety, having a vast knowledge in technology, engineering had approached so deeply and with such profound thoughts about our planet, lives defined so perfectly and sweetly  everything we should do."
1983,1983,"Elon is the m'fn man!! 

Thats all"
1984,1984,"Thank you Elon, for making the world a much better place, much faster."
1985,1985,"I think it is so important for the intense and brilliant rationality of Elon Musk to be coupled to the way the biology, chemistry, physics and economics of the planet interact. A world of abundance is possible if it is completely decoupled from destruction of natural systems and biodiversity. Or it's impossible. He never talks about planetary boundaries. They don't need to stop his optimism and creativity, but they need to be in his analysis."
1986,1986,"Elon ""Don't worry future is bright ""
Putin ""Hold my Beer"""
1987,1987,What I think Elon is saying 5 minutes into this interview is that he will need others to calculate ..engineer...test..finance...produce...etc etc to secure the future .
1988,1988,"Does anyone know here what Elon musk mean by ""Real world AI"" ? As in ""to solve self driving, you need to solve Real World AI"" (approximate quote)"
1989,1989,His factual recall is just amazing.  What a fascinating discussion.
1990,1990,"Elon, like all of us, is far from perfect but I can guarantee you someone else with this mental capacity and no monetary wealth would not necessarily be using their God given advantages for the improvement of humanity. Highly respect him."
1991,1991,Solar rockets.  Amazing.  Thanks 
1992,1992,This man is a P.I.M.P one of the smartest men alive. I wish I could talk to him such a inspirational person.
1993,1993,Man of century
1994,1994,Wow I never paid attention to Elon Musk before but he is so logical . I’m very intrigued 
1995,1995,"We can only hope that the world will come to accept the reality of goodness over the perception of it in the future, as Elon said. Such a powerful and enlightening sentiment."
1996,1996,Legit a real life tony stark who cares about the overall picture.
1997,1997,This interview belongs to Chris Anderson.  He has done a great job to get the best out of Elon Musk!
1998,1998,"Knowing The Future , You Design , We Can Change The Past evolving , You Know , PASTE MEANS EASTER ! All the Best , Daniela Zori !"
1999,1999,Watching this video made me wish I was born 100 years later into the future
2000,2000,"Amazing interview :) if Elon manage to create 10% of this interview , I really have hope for the future :)"
2001,2001,"Gigachad creates gigafactory, indubitably.  5Head"
2002,2002,Incredible interview. I haven’t watch something that interesting in a long time. Elon Musk is the Jesus of our millenia.
2003,2003,"Isn't battery manufactured from finite resources like cobalt? so while battery is renewable, the materials used for manufacturing battery aren't. How do we solve that?"
2004,2004,This interview will be watched in classrooms in the next century. Just amazing the human capacity for evolving.
2005,2005,Look at Elon getting emotional at people's hardship from 33:45 onward. You can see him fighting back the tears. This guy cares.
2006,2006,You want the future to be better? Make it so!
2007,2007,"Elon: I really want to make sure there is a good future for humanity and that we're on a path to understanding the nature of the universe, the meaning of life, why are we here, how did we get here. In order to understand the nature of the universe and all these fundamental questions we must expand the scope and scale of conscious. Certainly it must not diminish or go out."
2008,2008,I’m scared that when Elon dies it’ll leave a power vacuum
2009,2009,"It is so great that the world's MVP is an Engineer which aspires to change the world using a multitude of different ambitious projects. Not for personal benefits, but for the greater good.
We have a system that promotes and enabled him to get to the top and that gives me hope in society."
2010,2010,"We need humans to stay young, healthy and productive for longer. This should be our research main goal and this will give us more time to research everything else."
2011,2011,Just wanna point out how uncomfy interviews like this must be. Sittin almost knee to knee with someone. They have this very nice grey line that breaks up the interview well but when they hold their arms out you can tell they are in each others personal bubbles almost. I assume this is a constraint of the camera or a need for them the fill the frame but just look how close they are actually sitting.
2012,2012,Unique personality who is making the dreams come true in favor of humanity.
2013,2013,Oh please make half of my production team robots.
2014,2014,This man is an amazing interviewer.
2015,2015,The title absolutely sums up the talk. Excited for the future!
2016,2016,He might be able to build Iron Man suit
2017,2017,"On Mars self-determination and emerging polity:  ""...Where it is harder for people to make laws than it is to get rid of them..."" - rapidly passed over by the interviewer, but one of the most important things Elon said."
2018,2018,Even when elon musk makes kids its not beacuse he thinks of kids it's beacuse he trying to save humanity 
2019,2019,"Elon Musk is the most important person alive.  His prospering is our prospering.  I am impressed with the interviewer.  His intelligence is obvious in the interview process.  I appreciate the great direction and depth of his questioning.  Best hour I have spent in a long time.  Very, very well done!"
2020,2020,I’ve been writing research on future of multimodal logistics and all his projects are so damn dopeeeeeeeee
2021,2021,IT WILL BE GLORIOUS!!!
2022,2022,Mind-blowing visionary.
2023,2023,Grow human species for love of humanity: Philanthropy
2024,2024,Great interview and interviewer.
2025,2025,"I want a Tesla SO BAD! I just can’t quite afford one yet.  I’m hoping at 25k model gets announced sometime, that would open this up to the truly middle class population, living off 50-90k/year"
2026,2026,Someone please make batteries sustainable.
2027,2027,"Respect Elon!
Why do sooooo many people hate him?"
2028,2028,"the last topic: rich trillionaire, billionaires, - I have no problem as long as they put their wealth to create jobs in firms benefitting our society and earth !  Countries without them have a little chance to progress."
2029,2029,J’adore la voix d’Elon c’est lui qui devrai interviewer.
2030,2030,He is the most important guy for our world right now.
2031,2031,"Start working on a mother ship already, fly to Mars with a thousand ships on the mother ship ️"
2032,2032,Pls God protect Elon. The man of the century. Pushing us forward by doing the actual work instead of relying on lies and information control.
2033,2033,But there will always be that if. If  a person was driving would the accident be prevented.   AI can never  replace a human on the road without a train track of some kind.
2034,2034,What a legend!
2035,2035,I've read through many of the comments below and I also agree Elon is changing the world for the better. Imagine what he could achieve being President of the most powerful and influential nation in the world? We cannot ignore what an obstacle our government can be in terms of solving the world's most fundamental problem - greed. Would be very distracting for Tesla however it is a worthy thought.
2036,2036,Ask Elon what he thinks about a Tesla union
2037,2037,"How could Elon be so far away from the science that shows clear current impacts and increasingly severe future risks. Technological utopianism won't get us there, Elon!"
2038,2038,I’m pro nuclear to but what about  the nuclear waste . What is the solution for that?
2039,2039,"elon musk is the only “influential” person on planet earth i have never gotten a bad taste from, no matter how many videos i watch or papers i read. all around "
2040,2040,I used to listen to the podcast version. It's nice to hear new episodes again.
2041,2041,"If AI replaces people, what do the people do for an income ? and how can you expect people to purchase your products when they have no job, no money let alone somewhere to live."
2042,2042,You cannot predict time when inventing and creating something you will always face unforeseen problems. AI is extremely difficult to solve many like deepminds have been working on it for years
2043,2043,Awesome
2044,2044,"Tesla already has multiple businesses/companies under it (auto, energy, solar, insurance, etc). Wall St will not look favorably upon combining Space X, Boring Co, and Neuralink along with Tesla under one company. Elon understands this is not the best idea and would also not be in the best interest of Tesla shareholders at this time."
2045,2045,The recipe of success for the future is paying attention to the topics Ted Talk chooses to highlight. It happens every time.
2046,2046,Somebody has got to ask Elon Musk on Twitter if he saw the movie UPGRADE
2047,2047,"I also am thinking we need self driving which utilizes some sort of hearing as well.  I know I rely on being able to hear the vehicles around me while driving.  Ambulances and police sirens, horns, other people will probably need to be integrated into the ai as well."
2048,2048,i don't understand how anyone could trust a word that comes out of a billionaire's mouth
2049,2049,He said so many useful and interesting things. But all I remember is that he promised me a Robot Catgirl.
2050,2050,Imagine interviewing one of the most intelligent and amazing thinkers and doers on the planet and interrupting him LOL
2051,2051,"The major issue that is not being discussed is private corporations in the United States have mastered many of these technologies decades ago, and are being implemented as controlling mechanisms in the media, and the internet.  The reason we are in such deep $#%€ right now, is because technology advancements are being actively surpressed by not only the department of energy, but individual corporations that have ties to the NRO.  Technologies exist that could replace fossil fuels overnight, but they are ""proprietary technology"" and hidden at the NRO.  I know a woman who designed artifical intelligence for the NSA in the late 70s.  Trust me this technology is already mastered.  The NRO donated NASA a telescope 10x more advanced than the Hubble when the Hubble was being developed.  Let that sink in.  It was dead technology to the NRO and literally the best thing the NASA could make."
2052,2052,Great interview! Props for keeping comments on
2053,2053,Well the water is merely on the surface.. but below  that it's all dirt
2054,2054,Smart man thank God atleast someone is thinking of our species and how we can survive in the future 
2055,2055,"Thanks for the interview! Small tip: in order for YouTube chapters to show up on the seek bar, the first one needs to start at 00:00"
2056,2056,How long is he going to wear that Toupee for!?
2057,2057,"Tesla's difference from Ford, GM, Porsche, Rivian, Toyota and other EMV manufacturers is that, they're futuristic. Everything they do concerns our future."
2058,2058,"come on.... the Roko's basilisk, could we not. I mean we should definitely"
2059,2059,the man is a legend
2060,2060,My dad used to forecast for Wall Street and hearing Elon talking about it made laugh.
2061,2061,Bill Gates did a TED talk about eliminating 15% of the worlds population.
2062,2062,"Thank you, Elon. Thank you for not taking the political bait he threw at you."
2063,2063,Good video
2064,2064,You know all his upper level employees freak out when he gives these interviews
2065,2065,I know this guy is controversial. I'm not an Elon stan - I don't like some of his actions and decisions. But you cannot deny his massive impact on the world. So what if he tweets random stuff - that's his personality. I don't like people who have too much power but I hope that he uses that power for good. Great interview Chris!
2066,2066,"Please, Korean subtitle "
2067,2067,Common sense prayers Elon knows what he’s talking about knows what he’s doing
2068,2068,Great! I'll be able to drink till I'm blind and my car will take me home safely. Nice.
2069,2069,The man is simply incredible. The goat!!!
2070,2070,"""LIFE CANNOT SIMPLY BE ABOUT SOLVING ONE MISERABLE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER."""
2071,2071,Nikola Tesla would turn himself in his grave if he knew someone is making money from his name and achievements.
2072,2072,"elon musk is the hero we need and the hero we didn't know we deserved..
and he drives the libs absolutely insane  so that's a big plus.

go elon!"
2073,2073,so good
2074,2074,Who's hyped for the future and grateful that they are still young? 
2075,2075,"Here's my problem. I live in Kansas, traditionally one of the most authoritative Judeo-Christian Conservative states in the country. 42.2% of our energy was generated from wind turbines (built, run, and maintained in Kansas), only second to Iowa in the entire country. In fact, Kansas is the fourth most ""green"" state in the USA. Only 18.8% of the state's electricity was generated via coal, with the rest being a combination of nuclear, hydrothermal, geothermal, and natural gas. So you would think that Kansas has some of the cheapest electricity per kWh in the nation. Kansas doesn't. In fact, it's 10.2% higher than the national average, which is 29% higher than Oklahoma and 32% higher than Missouri per kWh. Evergy, which is the company that provides electricity to the bulk of Kansas, has consistently asked for increases every single year per kWh. They claim that this is due to ""the costs associated with maintaining wind turbines"" and ""building additional wind turbines"". The problem is that only 35% of Evergy's budget went to building new turbines, the rest was apparently ""maintaining"" the turbines. "
2076,2076,Hmm when else have I heard about a consensus of infalible hero scientists….? 
2077,2077,"Great interview, going to watch a space movie tonight"
2078,2078,"Robot catgirl

I'll take your entire stock."
2079,2079,"I know clean air HAS to happen, but I fear the full sun's affect on the CO2 we have."
2080,2080,"The plan should be to dense-pack Tesla-Bots into a starship as labor to build infrastructure, perhaps a few dozen managing engineers… People should be minimized at first."
2081,2081,"Batteries pollute even more so than oil and take away our minerals, electric cars are expensive and also need oil to recharge the batteries, We need oil also, come on man"
2082,2082,Enjoyed the interview but I wished the interviewer let the interviewed fully finished their response to ask the next question. Elon could not go deep answering really awesome questions.
2083,2083,The Singularity is Elon
2084,2084,I want to be alive to see that future of abundance
2085,2085,"No big on Elon based on actions. But, I never really heard him talk like this before and he doesn't irritate me which is surprising."
2086,2086,"Hey internet, here's a person with vision and the guts and brains to build a future. Let's destroy him by complaining about it!"
2087,2087,"This is the most wild inteview I have ever seen. He's like yo self driving cars, also here is how we're going to space."
2088,2088,"Minute 24:36 
I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK"
2089,2089,To hear Elon say something is not possible (electric rockets) is shocking considering he's not one to really talk that way.  The next person smarter than Elon needs to build the first reusable electric rocket.  I want to see that in my life time too please
2090,2090,"In order to sequester carbon, you have to have less factories taking up space, and have more trees and biodiversity to use up the carbon. Feed cows more seaweed and other types of plants reduce their emissions if we continue to have a high meat diet. stop using coal and gas. Build up nuclear power plants to be more efficient and safe. Build up efficient batteries that don't rely on rare metals. He's actually impressive on his ideas considering he had these thoughts since childhood."
2091,2091,good we can fire all the crying 15 dollar an hour people who cant get my order right at the drive thru window at minimum wage  who dont deserve to be paid more. They can all be replaced by a robot who would ideally get my order right EVERY time and cant call out sick or my babys daddy got caught selling weed and i gotta be off work so i can pay his bail. LOL
2092,2092,"""I promised the internet"" LMFAO such a sign of our times"
2093,2093,Elon for president.
2094,2094,Imagine people landing on Mars and a meteorite hits Mars at that time.. Great interview btw!
2095,2095,"History will mark Elon as top 2 in the history of men, maybe #1 of all time! Only competition, the one whom decided to leave the trees!"
2096,2096,Elon for president
2097,2097,The question to ask is whether the humanoid robots Elon creates will be the first (and maybe only) live-in residents on mars (and not man) because no man will sign up for the trip? And therefore when the inevitable Earth destruction occurs the only survivors of Earth will be ‘Star Trek Data-like’ humanoids?
2098,2098,humans will make great batteries
2099,2099,"The greatest Man in history, had no servants, and yet they called Him Master. He had no armies, and yet kings feared him. He won no military battles, and yet He conquered the world. He committed no crime, and yet they crucified Him. He is alive today. And His name is Elon Musk."
2100,2100,"Very simple, most people can't run a lemonade stand.  When you build and lead organizations of this size you are special.  Elon is special, he is also HUMAN he makes mistakes and talks sometimes from emotion.  We should all learn from his success instead of nitpick the setbacks."
2101,2101,"Im clearly not elon musk but talking about a battery we shouldnt be thinking electric. We should make hydrogen and use that as a ""battery"" for storing and transporting energy. Its clearly THE answer, idk why elon thinks Electric batterys are the future, but for me its clearly not."
2102,2102,"I think of Elon as a doctor, the earth is the mother, and we are the newborn. Elon takes us out of earth's protection, and brings us to a world that is new and different; life will not be as good as before, but we will cry out of it, just like when we were born."
2103,2103,please make us walk again by releasing promising successful treatment or medicine available for spinal cord complete injury we want to go for a long walk again please sir be kind hearted for us and save mankind and health better
2104,2104,"I admire Elon's work so much but I'm worried about his sanity a bit. It is nice that he does not spend his money for his needs but mainely for humanity in general but I think that if he wants not to get crazy and psychically sick from all these years of hard work that he sould have take a brain off vacation. 
I can feel his awarness about his life's limits but still It is not ok to be brain on for so long so I hope that he has breaks sometimes. "
2105,2105,"Musk won me over. Yeah, I'm a ""fan boy."" And not at all ashamed to say it."
2106,2106,This is God's Plan.
2107,2107,"16:03  That hard edit.. I'm betting Musk said something like. ""Yes Teslas can"" which could be a lawsuit."
2108,2108,Going to mars is cool but not really a favor to humanity..  Building a new civilization on Mars is less likely than solving all of Earth's problems..
2109,2109,Elon is unselfish human. humanitarian 
2110,2110,"Low cost energy? 
Sure...... with all the equipment needed, batteries which are expensive and expendable and all that. 
Even it's source is free of charge
I don't think there will be a cheaper energy than the carbohydrates, but the goal is not cheap, but clean energy (I believe)."
2111,2111,What happens if you go into debt in mars? Lmao
2112,2112,"Yes I really like this guy , which knowing my past records probably means trouble"
2113,2113,6:15 
2114,2114,Love is Greater than fear no matter how dark it gets
2115,2115,"Wow. Please Elon backup yourself somehow with your technology if you can, sooner rather than later. We need you and we love you. (tears)."
2116,2116,Elon_time x 2 = real time :)
2117,2117,This man is a global treasure.
2118,2118,"nuclear is fine as long as its not in my back yard and doesnt melt down like oh Chernobyl, fukashima, Kyshtym, Three Mile Island, Windscale, etcetc."
2119,2119,Such a banger interview.
2120,2120,"Things change exponentially and unpredictably as innovation, progress and discoveries happen. Compared to cavemen burning fire wood gasoline is clean energy so there is hope of progress. I think it will be something other than solar or wind as we know it now, those seem to be limited as how much space and materials it takes. Maybe a safer better form of nuclear power not yet discovered."
2121,2121,"Robot Catgirls confirmed. We did it, lads."
2122,2122,"This interview just cost Tesla $60 million dollars. 
(in opportunity cost according to Musk. One minute of his time is worth $1 million to Tesla 1:00:00)"
2123,2123,What about the release of methane gas escaping from ice melting nearing?
2124,2124,We need under water drones that would do enough damage to their war ships so they have to go into dry dock to repair them. We need anti ballistic weapons to stop their weapons. Underwater cameras can be great for science and exploration. Maybe they will find wealth at the bottom of the sea.
2125,2125,"I need to start investing in all of Elons businesses, cause Elon invest a lot in people."
2126,2126,Can't wait for robot catgirl
2127,2127,"Im thinking Elon's Boring company is doing more than building underground roads. The man is always 3 steps or more, ahead of the Game. "
2128,2128,GOAT
2129,2129,"Elon, you need to also start an educational system. Where people can grow and develop your mindset. You cannot expect people like you to rise from anywhere, when most people are waking up each day thinking about putting food on the table and paying the bills. You need an army of people with your mindset to accomplish the humanity goals even after you are gone. You do not care about Yachts and Buggatis and lavish life... your whole life is about humanity. I have two daughters that will be finishing off high school next year and they see the world as it is now and they do not like it much. If you make such an establishment, please let me know, we will be there! Thank you!"
2130,2130,Elon Musk seems to make his worst predictions when wishful thinking combines with assuming that his analysis is correct and the data is also flowing with the same controlling factors which in real world  scenarios tends to result in over simplifications until further in depth research reaches a higher level of understanding.
2131,2131,your going to leave every one behind. elon
2132,2132,It is good to have somebody who has bright ideas and is not a doomsday sayer.
2133,2133,"Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto !"
2134,2134,The idea that theres someone who hates Musk just doesn’t calculate in me… sadly theres so many that do. I cant ynderstand why. We are blessed to live and to watch his genius.
2135,2135,We seriously we need to trust elon our future his the only guy who can save us from destroying it
2136,2136,"We are lucky, at this time in world history, to have a visionary like Elon Musk, who has a great understanding of that is ethical and innovative."
2137,2137,My life's inspiration right there folks. In Elon I trust️
2138,2138,Detroit being human.
2139,2139,"It seems Elon is our only option for achievements beyond the mundane things. Impressive the Neurolink part: young paraplegic people imploring for quick advancements; TESLA and The Boring company combating the humongous threat of climate change. TESLA working on a robot for repetitive, dangerous and boring  tasks and solving the labor shortage issue. And last but not least, SpaceX working assisdously to preserve humanity. Let's keep the ball rolling among the youngsters for them to get inspired and cotinue the legacy of this ""hero"" (if you will) who is named, Elon Musk!"
2140,2140,I noticed the cut in the video when Elon started talking about population collapse. Cant have someone like Elon going against the narrative eh?
2141,2141,Run for president elon
2142,2142,"I think self-driving is far more promoted as being here and now.. because of Elon.. then is the reality... I just recently had a Tesla cut me off 3 times in a row within about a minute.. The driver looked at me completely confused after I eventually passed by him gesturing like ""why""?.. he wasn't ""Driving"" and the car was obviously trying to figure out a roundabout and a circle traffic way...  I was like.. okay clearly it's not ""there"" yet."
2143,2143,Dude is misdirecting you. None of this is true.
2144,2144,"Will the first users installed with neura-link have the abilities of Neo?… i.e. “i know kung fu” after downloading the high bandwidth recorded abilities of a another person who also had neura-link installed and already knew kung fu? 
Due to what can be captured and transferred can they learn things ‘virtually’ to a very high degree simply through a download?"

2149,2149,Maxwell Chikumbutso’s RFI invention would be perfect for use on Earth & Mars
2150,2150,i wonder if elon has considered potential energy storage. deep bore hole and a weight which is lifted by excess energy generation. they can store much more than chemical energy storage
2151,2151,Robots will replace humans in every way in every convention from feeding to learning to knowing and surviving lol people are just pest
2152,2152,"""I don't even own a home right now. I'm literally staying at friends' places."" - Elon"
2153,2153,"""I mean, these are just guesses. So please, people shouldn't hold me to these things. It's not like this is like some -- What tends to happen is I'll make some like, you know best guess and then people, in five years, there'll be some jerk that writes an article: Elon said this would happen and it didn't happen. He's a liar and a fool. It's very annoying when that happens. So these are just guesses this is just a converstation."" This is the first time I've heard him admit he has no idea what he's talking about."

Chris: Let's get back to what I was saying before"
2158,2158,Who will be the first self-made trillionaire by 2027 any predictions
2159,2159,The WW2 people said this is what we did and when it runs out they will come up with something new. If you can imagine or conceive it then you can build it. We knew how to plan it all out on the drawing board so building it was pretty easy because the math was already figured out.  Builder only needed a 10th grade level education. Good luck dealing with the people who can only function at a fifth grade level. They call them: GOV workers. My job was to go between the designer and the builder. There were fights and misunderstanding over what the original design was all about. Now my son works for gates pfizer to translate machine language into something the FDA can understand. He calls it PI planning.
2160,2160,"Almost anyone can afford $100,000 lol. This man is building Elysium."
2161,2161,It could have been so easy. I command the Devil to never look at me ever again Amen and amen.
2162,2162,I like to think the concept of population collapse is the same as the hive collapse syndrome.
2163,2163,"This is not in any way saying I'm smarter than Elon, but I'm glad he finally realized that AI is the key to success of fully autonomous self-driving any vehicle of sorts (which I have been pretty pessimistic about since the beginning of Tesla). For anyone who did try programming an AI will quickly realize how dumb the algorithm is and ironically, how far away we actually are from artificial intelligence. "
2164,2164,One way to avoid many battery cell issues and high costs  is to produce and store cheap hydrogen from solar / wind. Electric is not the panacea for efficient transportation for cars and such.

2166,2166,"23:00 The philosophical caliber of the questioner is very low, and not properly-integrated with other similar responses in the same domains. (I.e. Robert Heinlein, Ray Kurzweil, Harry Browne, David Nolan, etc.)"
2167,2167,"""I do not understand the critic from the left"". ""Conservative"" Americans and libertarians traditionally have very few problems with union busting and tax avoidance. I find it rather amazing that people criticizing this are characterized as ""left"". Cooperating with unions and paying your fair share of taxes are considered centrist positions in most western democracies."
2168,2168,Amber and Johnny strangely look like they are still in love .
2169,2169,Musk is the leader of humankind.
2170,2170,"If we go fully autonomous, we would be super producing everything. So, we could have a base pay for everyone. Whether you work or not. . I would love to help humanity and many other species, go further. With Neuro Link, that would be possible."
2171,2171,"As an Indian am wondering, why is he not talking about racism or religion or theocracy. I thought its about future.  What a goof."
2172,2172,"Elon Musk do you not think that making sustained habitation on mars is just a fad It's not exactly friendly to life and is very far away if something terrible happens, Besides there are lots of problems and questions we still have here on earth and your getting a bit ahead of yourself Elon."

2175,2175,Wow is all I can say!
2176,2176,Elon ask you How you are and you don’t answer?
2177,2177,"Elon says that we are ""on a good path"" to avoid climate catastrophe, as long as we are not complacent, have a high sense of urgency, and push hard to stay on this path. The problem is, according to the IPCC, we are not ""on a good path"". After the most recent UN COP 25 conference on climate change an analysis was made for where the current PLEDGES (which we are far from meeting) made by the worlds governments would get us to on eliminating greenhouse gases and stopping the increase in global warming. This analysis said that with those pledges, we are currently on track for 2.5 to 3.0 degrees Celsius of warming, which would be catastrophic if that is where we end up. Warming needs to be stopped at 1.5 to 2.0 degrees Celsius to avoid this looming catastrophe, and decades of efforts to even PLEDGE to be on a path towards that have so far failed miserably. Needless to say with the ACTUAL efforts being made to eliminate greenhouse gases, we are on a path to well over 3.0 degrees Celsius of warming, and absolute devastation of our climate and ecosystem."
2178,2178,"The greatest and most interesting billionaire ever. This guy has a huge impact on the future of humanity. Imagine if Elon was stuck in some soviet socialist economy, his potential and enourmous effect for us others would never have happened. God bless the USA for all its freedoms, and god bless the west for allowing freedom and opportunity. When I think about the future, sometimes yes I get sad, but when I think about the fact that I live in the same era as Elon I always get a smile on my face. What a man! How can someone not love this guy??? Thanks Elon for everything you do and you deserve every penny of the wealth you have created, never apologize for it!!!"
2179,2179,"Combine Neuro Link and Nano mites in human bodies. So the body can evolve, adapt and upgrade as well. Not just the mind. And if Neuro Link somehow damages anything, the Nano mites can immediately fix it.. Replace all cells in the body with exact copies only in Nano mites form. So we can become robotic without losing our souls. You're looking for the true transformation right? This is how."
2180,2180,He interviews much better when he does not have an audience to make juvenile jokes to.
2181,2181,"You inspire beyond borders, languages, personalities, politics, business, ethics, values and as a human. Thank you Elon. Listening to you is so refreshing, deep, insightful and happy. Thank you once again !"
2182,2182,"Reforestation and indigenous regeneration in tandem with all future visions to hold water, hold carbon, restore ecosystems, respect life."
2183,2183,nyron cint we’re gonna get mashed by an asteroid
2184,2184,Now this is a real interview. Historical one ️
2185,2185,high function savant.  Artificial intelligence has to function the way our unconscious mind does.  They need real time universal conscious so cars do not bump into each other. Everything in the universe (cosmos) connects in real time. If you want to hit or catch a baseball the math is very complicated - precise and the mind has to function very fast.
2186,2186,Elon Mars
2187,2187,It’s the right person to ask the future for sure not like Bill Gate

2192,2192,It became evident that Elon Musk is an avid reader of Tim Urban's Wait But Why blog :)
2193,2193,"Ouh poor baby. He doesn't have a home, boo fucking hoo. C'mon he doged the question in the most stupid possible way."
2194,2194,Rogan needs to get his Pharma Bros to take care of Elon. He's working to hard and not eating or sleeping enough
2195,2195,He makes me feel positive about our future.
2196,2196,"Didn't answer Elons question

How are you."
2197,2197,He will be our divine leader.  Accept him as your savior now or he will crush you into the dust.  Ave Elon!
2198,2198,Thats its what i have
2199,2199,"On cybernetic capability.
Considering the primary use of plastic surgey is now for cosmetic social advantage, rather than injuries.
Why would such implants not also be used for social advantage, as opposed to social re-integration by alleviating disability ?"
2200,2200,"Only elon could call our thumbs "" 2 little meat sticks"" lmao"
2201,2201,So Elona is a stutter or what? Somebody get that creep a Doctor
2202,2202,The end result is free energy for everyone everywhere
2203,2203,"i understand the interviewer trying to understand why people are trying to build up on the future
Bro, you are dying soon, so why dont we allow a generation to actaully do something withouht you're input
We have a plan and we'll get it sorted so chill out old fucks please and thankyou, becuase we didnt fight for freedom for nothing"
2204,2204,Free speech and Power to the people!
2205,2205,"I loved the quote:

2206,2206,this is NOT a ted talk
2207,2207,"Work toward real solutions that will not only give the people now an inspiring life but an inspiring future and children will blossom from every corner of the world. Give them depression, work them to death and have them feel they will never be free of debt and you will see birthrates plummet."
2208,2208,Isnt. The earth enough why are humans soooooooooooooo greedy.
2209,2209,"This was Elon Musk's and Chris Anderson's best interview ever.  Incredibly impressed by both Elon and Chris.  Thank you Chris for asking him this at 53:16, as I had thought that these companies were all intentionally planned around one another too.  They do work very well with one another."
2210,2210,A fantastic interview! So many possibilities.
2211,2211,Not his best haircut.
2212,2212,"Oil and gas is not the future we need to move forward on renewable energy and green energy , yes we can moderate the amount of oil and gas we ship and make use of but we need to use less oil  less gas and invest in new energy going global... Double U X 3 Up In Canada Us    ""Elon Musk"" is by far ""The Good Caption of a new Twitter Civilization, The Good Captain of Earth has my applause applause applause ""."
2213,2213,Planets fucked fam.
2214,2214,Elon Musk should be the President of the World!!!
2215,2215,"I truly believe that Elon has already changed the world, and more importantly has created an architecture by which the world will continue to change for the better"
2216,2216,54:19
2217,2217,"Interviewer: ""There is the whole generation coming through who seem really sad about the future. What would you say to them?""
Elon:  ""Well, I think if you want the future to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good. And it will be"""
2218,2218,The interviewr has very small hands
2219,2219,The hinderance to full self driving is lawsuits. You may develop better tech than people’s own driving skills… that won’t stop people from suing when an accident occurs and as a result causing manufacturers to shy away from releasing such tech.

2221,2221,Innovation Collaboration
2222,2222,"< Technical Analysis is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is dumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 11 btc from day tradng with David Walter, insights and signals in less than 2 weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.."
2223,2223,what is the best way to make money from crypto trading?
2224,2224,"I hope Elon mentions God in this interview. We can't do anything without God. People don't talk about it but God is in charge in the scheme of things. Read your Bible and learn we are not in the end times but in the end of end times. The Bible talks about the end times and what will happen and the things that will happen and we are there. Pay attention because we are close, very close."
2225,2225,"Wake up in morning and say Thank you God  for a good day. Yesterday I could Positively say that,not so much today. Now I can say Thank you God  for this moment. So much Chaos around the world with so much bad Politicians is there a future for our young children. God Bless This World. God  said Fear not I am with you. Amen"
2226,2226,
2227,2227,RIDICULOUS
2228,2228,Elon getting older and more Afrikaaner in the face.

2231,2231,this man is a revolutionary.. much respect
2232,2232,"The best future to look forward to is when Jesus comes and we get to have eternal life with Him. This life is fleeting and things pass away, eternal life is where our hope lies. God made this world to sustain us all. Global warming is false."
2233,2233,"A good interview request to find someone with great idea to share, but on this instance it mostly request someone with enough understanding of the situation to ask the good question. That is exactly what you achieved Chris. Great job. Great interview. Really worth a committed listening for every single second."
2234,2234,"I love this guy. 
A future worht getting exited about. THIS is a message. THIS is what humanity needs.

...as opposed to all that political theater bullshit that gets thrown around these days."
2235,2235,How did I stumble across this nonsense
2236,2236,This interview makes it very clear that Elon Musk comes across better and far more effectively when his is being interviewed by a skilled and sympathetic questioner that in his solo presentations. I am torn between envy of the sheer talent and drive of the man and wonder that I live in the same age as such a being..
2237,2237,Catgirls !!!! I want it ... they will cat marri me and do not mind that I am old...
2238,2238,Elon is the guy who got me interested in Sci-Fi. He's a real life movie character
2239,2239,"Great interview, thanks to Elon and Chris."
2240,2240,"""you could make a robot catgirl""  -- weebs everywhere going crazy"
2241,2241,"Yes amazing that end quote! Take action, make it so if you want a better future we all have to take accountability, Elon is definitely taking accountability to keep the human race going and keeping the light of consciousness alive. This was inspiring, keep up the amazing work Elon ️"
2242,2242,22:20
2243,2243,Absolutely amazing interview.
2244,2244,Elon talking about the purpose and gameplan for Neuralink in the first decade or so shows you what kind of man he is. Solving things like that for people is just incredible. Humanity can really produce some marvelous people from time to time
2245,2245,Robotics will not go much beyond remote control for the foreseeable future.
2246,2246,One can see the emotion and empathy at minute 34. Can he be a jerk at times? Sure. But he’s an amazing human being in general. Compassion for the entire species
2247,2247,24:35 ️
2248,2248,Sooo great to hear optimism about the future!
2249,2249,Always a pleasure to hear his interview
2250,2250,34:29
2251,2251,"I'd love to see a video of what it's like to be him for a day. How is it possible to juggle all these things and have time for everything.

A strong team I'm sure is essential but even then it's mind boggling"
2252,2252,49.14 =+_-  OK.LOOK. BYE THE TIME WE CAN GER THERE IN A RESONABLE TIME FRAIM ?  YOU SEND ROBOTS TO BUILD A CITY TO SUPORT FLESHY CREATURES. OK ddddaaaaa....

You are truly amazing  ..............."
2261,2261,"Have you thought about taking all these companies and combining them into one devoted to creating a future that's exiting? 
Yeah, it's called Elon Musk."

2264,2264,"Look at Elon man, so inspirational "
2265,2265,We love you Elon
2266,2266,"Elon is a great one!  The expansion of consciousness that he mentions, regarding the fact of inhabiting Mars, will also take place soon with the elucidation of our ethero-astral bodies to general knowledge."
2267,2267,Elon Musk
2268,2268,Elon could talk about interesting things all day and not repeat the same thing twice
2269,2269,"Excited about the future? Yes! While i find it admirable to look for solutions in neuroscience for tackling things like memory loss/dementia after it's been diagnosed, there seems less incentive to invest in ideas that have the potential to prevent it. Good talk. Thanks."
2270,2270,I think Elon and this TED tool should be the first to get a Neuralink.
2271,2271,Awesome work Musk !!!! Keep at it please .
2272,2272,I wish if elon can live forever man
2273,2273,To be able to access a fraction of this guy’s intellect would be freaking amazing!
2274,2274,"Elon has to be one of the few ""selfless"" persons on the planet, everything he tries to achieve is for the betterment and survival of mankind. He ought to be on the Kardashev scale...!"
2275,2275,I wonder how a 2 ton Tesla can be sustainable for the environment…
2276,2276,This man gives more hope and optimism for our future more than any politician i have ever listen to! Could not be more proud to be Tesla investor!
2277,2277,Elon
2278,2278,"I hope that someday, my motivation will be driven by the curiosity, instead economy. Respect to that man."
2279,2279,Probably the best interview I’ve ever seen.
2280,2280,"Thanks, Elon!"
2281,2281,These are the kinds of videos that make me hopeful for the future.
2282,2282,"That futuristic Tesla you're talking about ,is a train    in 2022"

*Avoiding climate catastrophy 01:20"
2287,2287,"I am glad I fast forwarded this interview, such. dud."
2288,2288,Truly Amazing Human being .. God Bless Elon Musk
2289,2289,Simply giving this video a “Thumbs up” feels grossly inadequate. I am both humbled by and grateful for this relatively short video. I sincerely hope that more than 400K people see it and take what EM says to heart.
2290,2290,Bravo !!
2291,2291,"For those that like this interviewer (Chris Andersson) I recommend watching his interview of scientist David Deutsch. David’s book is one that inspired him to take on the head role at Ted. (David being another great mind of our age, too)."
2292,2292,I like this interview but don't agree with everything. When he said: the only scarcity that will exist in the future is that which we create ourselves as humans. That's not really true is it? I mean we are making these products by using things that we have on this planet. These are finite resources.
2293,2293,"I like Teslas because they are a great car. I'm not convinced electric cars help save the world but Teslas, unlike other electric cars, are awesome in their own right."
2294,2294,What a quality of the video and this atmosphere is outstanding
2295,2295,How we know if this is the real Elon!? Hmmmmmm  guess it doesn't matter because the focus is of the future ahead of us!
2296,2296,A future to get excited about would be one in which people like this man would be more interested in helping this planet to thrive; less interested in bringing old destroyed planets back to life.
2297,2297,"Elon obviously amazing but the interviewer doesn't match his energy, Elon is a funny guy but the interviewer keeps asking about dates, prices, deadlines and other boring stuff, come man... just have a convo with him"
2298,2298,"Excelent interview to get up to date with the importan news, thanks!"
2299,2299,Best Elon interview I've seen.
2300,2300,Chris Anderson talks more than Elon Musk
2301,2301,What a great human ️
2302,2302,So much inspiration especially for the folks with Aspergers
2303,2303,"2050 isn't the doomsday on climate, it's 2030. It's amazing the ""let them eat cake"" nature of this conversation."
2304,2304,"To be brief. I am inspired and hopeful despite my misanthropic pessimistic views. The only thing keeping this world alive is Elon and ppl like him, the collective genius of humanity. ASPIRE my friends. "
2305,2305,"Huh, and here I was expecting a Judge Dredd type of future."
2306,2306,"Much Respect to Elon! 
A Great interview!"
2307,2307,Can hardly wait for the day I get my cybertruck. lol.
2308,2308,"Elon is definitely NOT a car company CEO ! he is much much more than a CEO, he is an ingeneer and a politician (in the plain sense of the word : ruling the city) and a philosopher. We need him because there is no one else like him on earth !"
2309,2309,"Elon, most of us learn by our mistakes and you certainly have.  Someone said that if you are not making mistakes then you are playing it too safe.  The challenge is to make mistakes faster and learn from them so you do not repeat the same mistake. That is progress!"
2310,2310,Elon you are awesome. Please make your Tesla's cheaper
2311,2311,The amount of undeserved and nonsensical hatred towards Elon is absurd. He's a genuine and a good person.
2312,2312,Too much hype has been giving to this dude.
2313,2313,"Elon has excellent ideas and he ""walks the walk"". It's not about money or ego either.. It's about passion. I pray for free energy for the future or at least very little cost. That's the real secret to ""  Nicola Tesla"". And yes I do believe the future is bright. Peace needs to be our top goal. X"
2314,2314,Elon is Genius! Hoping he gets ahold of Twitter too!
2315,2315,Who else thinks Chris talked more than Elon?
2316,2316,"The frustrating thing about our world is that the people who have already made up their minds about what kind of person Elon is (e.g. that he is a megalomaniac, self-interested, etc...) are unlikely to take the time to watch interviews such as this. "
2317,2317,"Interesting Human; Though, as per, we only know what Is said, whereas plans of what already exists. Won't be spoken about! I do like him though"
2318,2318,"""The only scarcity that will exist in the future will be that which we decide to create ourselves as humans.""  

Big, huge missed opportunity to at least briefly mention that given the requisite technology, we still need massive paradigm changes in our present systems of governance and economics for this to come true; indeed without serious paradigm shift, I think it's likely that we get the opposite of what he predicts.  His utopia is possible, very much not a given.  And I think he knows this.  Why doesn't he bother to mention this caveat, even if he doesn't see that as his role in this puzzle?"
2319,2319,"Elon has some questionable views and dealing with China.. but still he’s just the right person to further society as a whole.. his biggest issue is his mind works too quick and he’s to smart to communicate well with people. As is actually historically common as most geniuses were originally considered autistic and rightfully so as in the purest sense autism is actually an over achieving not under achieving issue making it harder to do basic everyday things but usually due to heighten hearing, feel, etc.."
2320,2320,Is there anything new in this interview? Same questions and same answers. I'm surprised Elon does not tire of giving the same answers again and again.
2321,2321,"Someone should really ask hard questions to Elon. Like what about the racism in his factory, how exactly are we going to be CO2 neutral, when we all have increasing energy needs with more HVAC systems being built and our PCs starting to consume more and more energy as Nvidia/AMD/Intel pumps out GPUs/CPUs that consume more and more power. But the worst point is, that all developing nations that currently doesn't use much energy per household will want the same things as americans, so their comfort will come with so much more pollution."
2322,2322,Thanks you អរគុណបង
2323,2323,If Elon spent some time to research Molten Salt Reactors I'm sure he would see the amazing potential for that as the next 'industrial' revolution !!
2324,2324,Thanks for sharing this with us!
2325,2325,"It's not about solar and wind, nuclear power of the future. Incredible.... batteries will harness the power.
There is just not enough commodities out there. Do the maths."
2326,2326,good interview asked the questions we all wanna know.
2327,2327,Like a priest having a conversation with his God.
2328,2328,Impressive mind. Impressive follow through.  
2329,2329,I admire Norway & Iceland in so many ways they have been leading in clean sustainable energy - sadly the US still has climate deniers in govt which is blocking progress in most sectors
2330,2330,Elon for president ;)
2331,2331,"We need more Elons!!!
:D"
2332,2332,Maybe use the robots to prep Mars and make it nicer .. Then the people will go.
2333,2333,"I'm no expert in science and engineering, but it's so interesting to listen to him speak with such passion about his work and plans. He's already achieved amazing things and he still has so many ideas. If only political creme de la creme would pay attention to him more. There are probably quite a few unreligious people here but I as a deeply religious person think that Mr Musk has many God-given talents. He's doing a great job for improving life on earth, and yet he doesn't have a God complex. I also think he's often being misunderstood, but he seems to be really down-to-earth, goodhearted guy who wants to help people. The wealthiest man in the world who is not unhealthily attached to his money. Unbelievably dedicated visionary of the 21st century. May God bless him and his endeavours."
2334,2334,"The way Elon musk talks, you just have to believe him."
2335,2335,"Neuralink... would this work for PTSD, ADHD, and General Anxiety Disorder? If so.. sign me up!"
2336,2336,I know he is a lightning rod...but Elon is a remarkable person.  People love to attack him but name someone that's done more for the advancement of humans in the last 20 years.
2337,2337,A future the average man can’t afford.
2338,2338,Exquisite interview.
2339,2339,"Musk is a great engineer and entrepreneur. I f you have a great idea that will change the future, just go for it, take action."
2340,2340,Goods and services in abundance. < Inherent human greed.
2341,2341,"I agree with almost everything he said, except the notion of ""population collapse"", which just seems absurd to me.
If having a lower population was somehow a liability, then as a species we should never have been able to get to the point where things like Tesla or spaceflight were possible.  And this is especially (even ironically) true, given Musk's prophecies of automation solving most of our labor challenges, and an emerging ""age of abundance"".  So how would having say, 6 or 7 billion humans on earth instead of 8, possibly be a problem?"
2342,2342,This man is........
2343,2343,Imagine Elon as the POTUS and how he can push a huge leap ahead of innovation that will propel the USA forward with his visionary outlooks.
2344,2344,You can see Elon upgraded speech processing speed by a few Terbytes.
2345,2345,"yeah, I don't really have the same optimism as Elon. never going to have kids. don't want anything to do with humanity. great interview though."
2346,2346,I am blown away from the things I just heard. Future is exiting
2347,2347,"wait, so three days in and the video didn't have a single like? that isn't believable."
2348,2348,Elon Musk wakes up every day with the ability to end world hunger four times over and chooses not to.
2349,2349,Protect this man at all cost
2350,2350,"23:31 yesss please, we don’t need Terminator 2 up in here"
2351,2351,Why so much negativity from the interviewer..if the stuff hes doing was easy everyone would do it. He gotta have high goals n standards
2352,2352,"If it's ought to be, it's up to me. 1:05:30"
2353,2353,"elon thank you. 
before i learned about you mainly and a few others, i wanted to die. i also had no hope and thought humanity is doomed. now the mentally ill parts of me tries to convince me to die, but i try to hold on, i tell it, lets give neuralink a chance. also chill, humanity might not be doomed after all."
2354,2354,"Oh Elon is a normal,good,genius caring and awesome person. I don't mind him being a trillionaire let alone being a multimillionaire. He is doing a fantastic and useful job for humanity. And he is from Africa Thank God for Elon Musk."
2355,2355,"@34:15 I dunno Elon, CAN you fix it?? I mean, you are just guessing after all..,so maybe you can’t do any of this, but I don’t think it will be for a lack of taxpayer funded research."
2356,2356,"It was quite interesting interview, sadly you let passed a good opportunity to ask about  one of the major pollutants on the roads, Diesel semi trucks or class 8 trucks, you didn't ask for Tesla Semi production and delivery time frame "
2357,2357,Great meeting
2358,2358,"Chris is great at interviewing,"
2359,2359,"Being interviewed by a TedX representative at least give this visionary who is helping humanity progress finally in a positive direction respect while interviewing him! 
Look at the facial expressions of your interviewer as Elon is answering and about to finish.. This guy isn’t even listening to his answers properly …"
2360,2360,"The dream seller that became the most rich person on universe ...mr sandeman , give me a dream..."
2361,2361,"Once Elon mentioned that he's gonna be long dead before he sees Mars people sustain and live there, I couldn't stop imaging people in Mars watching this video couple hundred years from now."
2362,2362,Building a house of cards on a foundation of sand. How is that going to feed the starving millions?
2363,2363,"I would love to buy an electric vehicle, however I go off grid camping in my van a lot so I do not see myself ever purchasing an ev unless it has rooftop solar panels"
2364,2364,"""If you care about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it...""  
Man, how that calls out so many ""activists""."
2365,2365,Elon Musk: The Movie - Starring Matthew Stafford.
2366,2366,"Amazon has been working on a “Rosie” robot for quite some time. Autonomous cars is one thing, but watch this space. You will see domestic robots coming on the market within the next 10+ years."
2367,2367,Was this an interview or this old dude trying run SpaceX?
2368,2368,Best ELON MUSK interview ever!
2369,2369,"Definitely Elon! After July 19, 2023 in Milwaukee I’ll be able to do anything that I want with my future. When I get back to Texas I would love to see your factory in Austin! Hope you’re doing well bud!"
2370,2370,A robot in each home? 24:10 have you heard of Rumba?
2371,2371,"If you expect a robot (artificial intelligence) smart enough to do capable anything you want and same time to be stupid enough to be a slave to you, you are inconsistent."
2372,2372,"Operation High Jump(1946-1947) Admiral bird and the U.S navy go to Antarctica which is the ice border, that surrounds the earth that is connected to the dome. He hits the dome, and it was to high for him to get over. 

V2 Rocket(1947) U.S lies about launching fruit flies into space from a missile launch site in white sands New Mexico. They said that the fruit flies died during reentry. "
2373,2373,"We’ve been programmed to go to work for centuries and our interests that make us the most happy to be viewed as “hobbies “.  It will take some time to “de program “ that thinking, and live your life creating what makes you happy. It is possible to think positive all the time."
2374,2374,We need only 5 more Elon in this crazy world
2375,2375,Plants some trees on Mars for oxygen 
2376,2376,This is the first time i've seen Elon looked pretty aged.
2377,2377,Agreed.
2378,2378,"I don’t care if you like him or not; he can say silly things on Twitter regularly and maybe have questionable takes. 

But this man is propelling our society forward the way Aristotle or Copernicus, Einstein and others did. They have outrageous ideas but force us to confront limitations and push past them. "
2379,2379,You are my North... you are my North Star  ... Everything around me driving me to insanity... my heart is like a compass always pointing to you... only your words balance my existence... for the sake of philanthropy please keep it to the science... I like it more like that
2380,2380,no brain implants keep humans human.
2381,2381,"Expand the scope and scale of CONSCIOUSNESS!!  YES, this is the most important thing that humanity needs to aspire to now."
2382,2382,"13 seconds in Elon looks fat, I think he’s getting out of touch with us, he lost me a few months ago with his anti-electric investment arguments for the Feds, now compared to that journalist I can see he’s twice his size I know he’s lost touch and I can fully support Jeff Bezos now.  "
2383,2383,"Thank you, God, for bringing Elon to save us <3"
2384,2384,From the looks of things back on earth the Boring Co will be mostly needed to create underground living facilities. I sure would like to see some entrepreneurs of the quality of Elon working to overturn our current political stagnation. Something has to evolve on that level to ensure the innovations on Elon’s and the other’s levels. Bravo human advancements!
2385,2385,"try auto self driving car in Surat / Mumbai ,.. you will never fail if it self drives in these cities ,.. hahah"
2386,2386,"Chris is absolutely obsessed with due dates. “Ok, but the timeline tho”"
2387,2387,Elo: what about reciclying the batteries!? How much they polute!? Wtf we do with them!?they don.t last 4ever!
2388,2388,"The DTU, have made big strides in stone “ battery “. Full scale test are going on atm, in Denmark. And I do think the epic tokamak project in France ITER is gonna be awesome when it hit Q10."
2389,2389,Just when im feeling at my worst theres elon to make it better
2390,2390,I'm trying to launch my rescue and relief operations globally. 
2391,2391,"only question I have with the optimist that says ""things will be fine"" , for whom will it be fine, and who do WE consider part of US ?  Surely it will be fine when all the useless people are gone.  Very comforting."
2392,2392,Thank God he's pro nuclear
2393,2393,"they keep citing Tesla's rise as a prediction Elon did well, but this is the field of economics, not about when we invent x which seem to be a lot of his other predictions
I do enjoy Elon talking big though, I hope he can manage greater things. I am skeptical about his vision of ""the Era of Abundance"", unless we become able to mine asteroids within the next 15 years"
2394,2394,What a lad 
2395,2395,Nice $66 million dollar conversation
2396,2396,"Just to be clear this is the Elon Musk who tweeted ""We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it."" right?  This pertained to Bolivia. His company needed the lithium deposits there.

Interesting person to hold in high regard..."
2397,2397,"I don’t get it? Why do we need self-driving cars? It seems that it’s another addition to a long list of items where individual self autonomy is being given up in the name of safety and convenience. In many regards, technological progress isn’t progress for humankind at all."
2398,2398,"I feel the most excited for the future when driving around Austin, listening to I.G.Y"
2399,2399,the next 20 years will be mind boggling!!!!!!!
2400,2400,The interviewer is the wrong man to be interviewing Elon. The interviewer is not very technical and ask basic questions with obvious answers. Someone more technical will be able to ask better questions.
2401,2401,I would imagine most of the people that go to mars first would be workers going to build the infrastructure for survival and resource collection and refinement. They should also be paid so well that after say a 4 or 6 year duration they'd be able to retire wealthy.
2402,2402,"I we couple the humanoid with the data of the internet available, if the humanoid able to understand our  conversation, then that will be the most evilistic, abusive, full of foul hatred, manipulating creature ever. A culmination of human wrongs. OMG, so sorry to the humans."
2403,2403,So wait you mean to tell me that people criticize Elon’s timelines but then ask for timelines on ground breaking tech? I really wish people would just appreciate the massive advancement that are happening rather then complain about when something is going to happen.
2404,2404,beautiful speech
2405,2405,Compressed Light into Plasma Energy ..?
2406,2406,"Elon, would you be helping out in the Medical field ?? Vision & Limb replacements/mobility issues & related human issues ??
That would be so, so awesome."
2407,2407,"Brace yourselves, The Muskrat simps are here in full force"
2408,2408,He's a peaceful soul.
2409,2409,"""I have decided to take action now,so that my future will be good."" Elon Musk will save the world. Excellent video!"
2410,2410,3rd Comment: I think that there should be a couple loads of ‘Fallen Angels’ allowed a flight home.
2411,2411,"One grid were everyone gets there energy needs. And it will be very cheap. Ha,ha ha,ha times a thousand. Obviously someone doesn't understand human nature. Love you Elon. Keep moving forward."
2412,2412,"i will be a cyborg in the future, healing people by licking their g spot and providing therapy...take down earth hahah"
2413,2413,"He says he promised the internet to make catgirls real. He expects to do this with robots, and I thank him for that, but I want fully functional cat ears(using bone conduction) or catgirls via DNA modification."
2414,2414,I like the sound of regulating AI. However history is showing people don't give a damn about regulations if there's a buck to be made. And for giant corporations it's cheaper to just pay the fine than it is to comply
2415,2415,I can't WAIT to make a loan to go to Mars! Goodluck getting your money back!
2416,2416,The best way we learn is by making mistakes. Keep making mistakes Elon.
2417,2417,How can I buy a car made in Texas?
2418,2418,"My biggest two things, there isn't a worker shortage but a fair pay shortage, and the neura link needs to be affordable to the mass or else it will cause a rift in classes between the wealthy and the lesser fortunate."
2419,2419,Fantastic job at letting the man speak
2420,2420,24:35 still hope for our cat girls fellas
2421,2421,Vast solar arrays + Fluoride based batteries = the future of energy on Earth
2422,2422,"Not impressed by Elon Musk , or his manufacturing process.
Science guru not."
2423,2423,"This is the correct way to talk to Elon Musk, and correct topics to talk about."
2424,2424,Everyone in the world should listen to this at least once
2425,2425,"Why did it heard to me as ""falking 9""rocket"
2426,2426,Love it
2427,2427,elon thinks were fine don't worry ... are we on the same planet
2428,2428,"To solve self driving in five year you need to transfer some of the responsibility  from the car or truck to the road network.  The current road network uses signs, road markings, etc. to help the human driver drive safely.  So, Buttigieg's Dept of Transportation needs to provide similar aids for machine drivers.  For example, simple devices embedded in the road or along the side which the machine can ""see"" or ""hear"" and transfer information from car to car locally."
2429,2429,"Why is it taking so long for the regulatory bodies to approve this? It is clearly going to fix a lot of current issues, for which, literally, no one else has got an answer.."
2430,2430,"No news here.
TED talks use to be differents..."
2431,2431,"A FUTURE CAN NOT BE BUILD WITHOUT TECHNICAL SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE, much less with free speech!"
2432,2432,Robt could sent other plant  to build  for  people  and have  place  all read  for  people live it   when space travel is made better !!
2433,2433,"“Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; & therefore is winged Cupid painted blind”"
2434,2434,"46:02 Yes, because on a salary of 2,000 dollars a month before rent, utilities etc I can easily save up 100,000 dollars. :)"
2435,2435,Interesting
2436,2436,"This is the Elon I love! 

When he talks about doggie coins and 420 memes I want to vomit. He is profoundly serious in his endeavours, and it gets undermined quite quickly with discussion of nonsensical topics."
2437,2437,Its seem little strange compared Mr Elqn Musk respondse harsh as straigh forward and awkward
2438,2438,Still waiting for self-autonomous driving you promised for a couple years straight btw.
2439,2439,"Btw batteries come in many forms not just the li-ion ones. We can store energy in compressed air. Other types of electric batteries (sulfur, Aluminum,..) or even in potential energy. So we do not need 300 terrawat li-ion battery farms. All of these technologies will help us to store/buffer the renewable energy."
2440,2440,Let's not platform Elon Musk
2441,2441,A future without billionaires is what I get excited about.
2442,2442,"I cant listen to this man on the left, he is so unappreciative. He’s speaking to greatest man of our times who is gonna be forever in history books. I think he’s got bad teeth and cant smile or laugh"
2443,2443,"Looking forward to robot sports... soccer, cricket... hilarious."
2444,2444,AI = Universal Credit. The issue is that corporations are going to have to make a massive contribution from their massively increased profits thanks to AI
2445,2445,10 commandments seem like short enough laws for people to understand:)
2446,2446,"To address climate catastrophe from overheating our planet and the resulting economic and environmental damage, the question that should have been posed to Elon is ""just what do you think the government should do to offset the present built-in economic subsidies for fossil fuels, perpetuating the carbon emissions disrupting our climate/weather patterns?"""
2447,2447,Resistance is futile; you will be assimilated.
2448,2448,Well done Ellon there comes a stage where money is not a issue millions or pennies
2449,2449,"Had an idea while watching this. If the world is 70% water, why not build more land on that water? That would help solve a lot of issues overpopulation, running out of land to farm, we could plant trees/plants on that land which would produce more oxygen..if we can do all the things he’s taking about why not this?"
2450,2450,"To me, regarding self driving cars, the most important thing is taking over my driving on long, inter-state hi-way journeys. This would allow me to sleep, read, and relax and let automation do it's job in a way that TRULY would affect my quality of life. Fifteen minute drives to work in the city I don't mind doing myself. The beauty is that interstate driving has the LEAST amount of AI variance required. It's those highly varied inner-city AI experiences that are EXTREMELY hard to model. So, with my philosophy I would not be surprised if we are not already there. Let's forget about complex inner-city driving, get the technology up and running for interstate travel, and then tweak the intra-city complexities later. Let's not delay implementing the most valuable part of the equation so that we can get it 100% right. One valuable, and usable step at a time."
2451,2451,"Can anyone please let Elon Musk know that he can help NASA with the DART project.   
Building a lazer with a drilling end and a electro magnet placed on a falcon nine, can greatly improve the survival of humanity.   Lazers can detect and melt materials like ice, magnets can repel most astroids.  And worst scenario, it can automatically attach the falcon nine with robotic arms to land and drill into the asteroid..  eventually by turning the raptor engines on, he can send it to a different course. Worst scenario-it can explode the asteroid that can end humanity.  "
2452,2452,The bass is so boosted that i think this is for poor people.
2453,2453,Thank you Mr Elon Musk        God bless you help make 🇺🇸  🇺🇲 🇺🇸  🇺🇲 greatest  forever  
2454,2454,"Tesla Self drive seems to progress like a child... he refers to his companies like children fairly often (he is a father of many actual children)...

I feel that in a future where there are digital beings with personhood, that periods of time, like when the Tesla's were stopping harshly and randomly will be seen as tragic analogues to AI PTSD, and progressions like ""object permanence"" will be romanticized like a baby's scrapbook."
2455,2455,"I think we should give the Twits a run for their money - save you some money by stealing all their customers - and begin the ""Days of FART"". Because you put the art in fart. And it should be something to talk about, Bink. Wink. Smile."
2456,2456,"Um, I don't think anyone is going to be able to take out a loan to pay for their trip to Mars.  Um, because they are not likely coming back, and as Elon says, the first people to go, will have the highest risk of death.  lol"
2457,2457,my bookmarks : 26:45
2458,2458,I personally found the pushing for predictions by the interviewer annoying.  Elon is amazing.
2459,2459,"So grateful that Elon exists and all he does. There are no words. I don't see how humanity decline would be an issue. People produce too much unsustainable trash. The less people the better, especially with AI coming up, helping to manifest abundance for humanity. Once sustainability takes off,  we always can have more of us. It's not in the numbers, it's in the quality of a sustainable thinking  mind"
2460,2460,"Also @21:50, anyone ever see Terminator???"
2461,2461,I have a special message for Elon Musk. Go Andy Build your Platform one Mars Bring ase many of Your close family Along. You are Rich And Have a high Goal. Let Nobody stop you do it ASAP or you miss the schedule.
2462,2462,Thanks
2463,2463,"Every social/economic system in mans history owes its creation, and eventual demise, to technology convergences. Events that fundamentally changed our relationship to our environments, and thus our society as a whole, because the human species is a behavioral product of its environment. It is this attribute that has allowed us to adapt to virtually every environment on earth. Every model has had a technological best before date. Our current system is based upon the presence of artificially created scarcity for profits today. It is not designed to solve problems. Its designed to perpetuate problems for profits. Because if you actually solve the issues of scarcity? There is no way to profit from it anymore. It will no longer function in a world of abundance. Labor (both physical and mental) is now adverse to productivity and efficiency in our digitally enabled reality. And even the programmers and engineers are not immune to the advancements in AI. We are already using them to cut workloads today."
2464,2464,"Hey Elon- Bad people do bad things.  So by default, bad people will control robots to do bad things."
2465,2465,oh hey that's the guy that stole tesla company from its founders
2466,2466,"Externalizes costs in order to internalize profits for himself, at everyone elses expense. Despite that he is somehow treated like our glorious benefactor. We live in dark times."
2467,2467,Ted Ted Ted Ted how many edits did you make? How many words cropped? How biased. How you framed the discussion was rather annoying overly obsessed with forecasting beyond the necessity. Genius doesn't need a test of time by you. Time means nothing without results. Results
2468,2468,Elon will end up on Mars with his robots. He won't die.
2469,2469,"Elon , please do not forsake your country of birth , South Africa . 

Our electricity supply as it is , is unsustainable  , but we are mineral rich ."
2470,2470,WHERE IS MY CATGIRL!!!
2471,2471,Elon has Ironman’s intelligence and Captain America’s morality.
2472,2472,Fresh water fresh water fresh water fresh water fresh water.
2473,2473,"Did he just say that almost anyone can afford 100,000$ to go to Mars? Elon seems very out of touch from the common people."
2474,2474,Its amazing how he can strike the perfect balance between his twitter personality and this!
2475,2475,Most overrated human being right now...
2476,2476,"If you really want to make a change in the climate, Elon, stop making expensive electric cars that people making minimum wage could never afford.  It can't be that hard to make a simple economy car that is less than $20k.  Most poor people can do without the luxury of electronics that don't directly control the car's motor.  If putting the Tesla name on rock bottom priced basic transportation is somehow distasteful, then give a company like Aptera a Billion to offer an economy car and help them mass produce it.  There is no reason why a person living in an apartment and working for minimum wage can not afford an electric car that is safe and reliable, not likely to catch fire, can be driven a week back and forth to work before needing to be charged, and is environmentally friendly.   When my Toyota van needed a new $500 window motor I simply opened the door instead!  We need to redefine what is necessary in a car and throw out anything that wastes money and energy."
2477,2477,"John 14:6 Jesus said to him,  ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.
1 Corinthians 15:3 that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. "
2478,2478,"Wow, Elon pushing that ""we have a huge shortage of labour"" narrative haaaard."
2479,2479,"Humanity needs to shed greed , before any kind of abundance, and I'm sorry Elon,  mankind is along way off yet ."
2480,2480,"Why this guy takes so long to ask question. Hes so annoying, let Elon speak"
2481,2481,"Dear Elon, a world made uninhabitable by plastic trash isn't really worth one making all these great things for so maybe work on a viable solution for plastic waste, particularly single-use plastic. Thanks."
2482,2482,Tesla and Elon are not good.
2483,2483,"I am kinda sorry for people who rant on musk. It feels like a kid crying to his momma to have delayed serving an apple pie. We see the progress and we all should be if not already, a part of and support to his contribution to mankind. He isn’t promising a supply chain optimization like an amazon delivery, it’s an evolution of human intelligence and lifestyle. These are experiments and will take time for best results"
2484,2484,"I would think you could build a social media platform equal to or better than Twitter for $45 Billion dollars. The technology is already there, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Build a better mouse trap and the world will beat a path to your door…"
2485,2485,My goat
2486,2486,"Looking forward to a new country on Mars called ""Newkraine""."
2487,2487,Make it so... xD
2488,2488,"I’m really not trying to hate, and I’m sure Elon is quite intelligent and creative, but what has he said or done that qualifies him as a genius? Again, not hating on him, but I’m not sure why people think he is so extraordinary in terms of intellectual capacity and innovation."
2489,2489,so musk speaks of what he has shares of.  no mention of the spiritual or GOD which are already sustained.
2490,2490,"Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life"" (John 3:16)"
2491,2491,"We choose which delusions we want to follow. Some delusions can be healthy, with positive potential, while others, destructive. It could be the delusion of fame and fortune, or that science will fix everything for us, or that we need law and religion to be ethical, or that you are god incarnate. Which delusions cage your mind and which free it? We think we know what is real, but it's all human social construct. One thing I feel is real is that we are not merely visitors here, not only part of this reality, we are in fact the universe, experiencing itself as individuals. Everything that exists adding its unique conscious perspective. The elements of our bodies were forged in the stars, yet our consciousness is somehow not our body. And how awesome it is to get the human experience! Allowing us to share in great detail our individual perspectives and experiences, being able to imagine the infinite potential we, as life on earth, have yet to realize. I follow this delusion and I choose to believe we will collectively understand that we as humanity, are the ones that choose the quality of our world. The only thing holding us back is ourselves. We can choose to doubt ourselves or to believe in our limitless potential. Our reality seems to bend toward what we think and express. So I choose to imagine and speak of a utopian future, all living things in harmony and balance, learning from the intelligence of evolution to advance and create ideas and technology to make life more enjoyable for all of us equally, to protect life from existential threats. I would much rather be a nobody in that world than a winner of this competitive world. We choose."
2492,2492,5:25
2493,2493,"I love when Elon jokes about AI enslaving us or taking over humanity. While the jokes are a nice touch, I think they are an important reminder to any of us who work in or hobby with AI.

Computers aren't smart, they do only exactly what we program them to do. Programming a computer to learn is hard but not rocket science. The part that I think will surpass the difficulty of rocket science is programming a computer to learn right from wrong and transforming that into logic."
2494,2494,"This man gives hope to human kind and the sustainability of our planet.  

Also, Can you imagine having a robot as your home security?  Attack any sob breaking into your house while you’re at home or away.  And put out any fire hazard while at it.  The possibility is vast."
2495,2495,Cat girls confirmed
2496,2496,"A few years ago this interview even in a sci-fi movie would have seemed a little too far fetched, what Elon has achieved and is striving to achieve is just unreal."
2497,2497,watch the thunderf00t videos on elon musk for the other side of the story.
2498,2498,"Excellent interview and a great opportunity to get a glimpse of what drives & motivates the man.  I wish him a long life and success in his noble endeavours.  I am however at a loss as to why some dislike him for just being extremely wealthy - understandable if it’s just greed, ostentatious lifestyle and corruption of the political elites.  But he doesn’t appear to have that.  He has created his wealth and provides jobs and opportunities for tens of thousands of people.  His detractors are apparently mostly on the left. Surely it has to be what he does with his wealth. His life style according to him at least is not ostentatious.  Is his effort to try and save the planet from an environmental catastrophe not the height of a philanthropic act?"
2499,2499,Bravo Elon. You gave hope and optimism to our future!
2500,2500,35:00 thats why i ape into shitcoins
2501,2501,"Wow what a great interview. Love everything Elon is doing. But I did get 1 major takeaway from that....He consistently wants to manufacture what most people want, and this is not a bad thing, but a long envisioned system of ""build it and they will come"". Don't get me wrong, I'm totally for this and it's great to see someone actually doing it"
2502,2502,Comb your dam hair.
2503,2503,"I am so happy to hear and share all the good things he is doing for the world. He has said: ""if you want the future to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good, and it would be."" Such a powerful and simple message."
2504,2504,This is why I was so glad to be a part of Tesla for 5 years.
2505,2505,Construcive is not Bum Licking
2506,2506,"Wow, what a great Interview. It was extremely entertaining and informative. Really great questions were asked. I personally believe Elon is the brains of the 21st century. I don't want to be a fanboy, but I really can't help it with the future that he describes. The only thing I think he might be wrong on is his push for solar and wind. I would really like him to really invest his time in money in small modular nuclear reactors placed strategically along the grid for power. There are a lot of great modular reactor companies that could use the capital to get started. the reactors that can be built in warehouses and turned out in droves to power the world. If he can build a mile long factory for cars I am sure he could build a factory to produce these type of reactors. Machines to build the machines to supply power for the world."
2507,2507,"Some people remember their past lives. So now, when that people will incarnate again, they can go on with their old profiles on social media or anywhere! Just remember your password!)"
2508,2508,"Great interview. 

And the new generation should indeed take action. Stop staring at social media all day and try to make something of your life."
2509,2509,This interview will be a testimony to human ingenuity in the years to come. Mark my words ️
2510,2510,Tony Stark

2513,2513,"One sibling is beating up the other sibling.  Robot hears ""Stop! Stop! Stop!""...and stops."
2514,2514,"You HAVE TO be a genius to realize that every question in this interview was from an investor's perspective point of view.  Not a fan, but i really-really enjoyed Joe Rogan's interview with a far more RELAXED Elon.  Everytime TED spits a question, i see a financial interest only behind the context rather then beeing honest and curious while asking about how will the future look like. "
2515,2515,love this interview
2516,2516,"The Young Global Leaders (YGL) is a five-year World Economic Forum training program that handpicks individuals most likely to succeed in politics or corporate governance, and as key influencers. The program’s agenda is secret, and it is very rare that a graduate will discuss in publicly. Global corporatism and social engineering are main components of the program. "
2517,2517,Fantastic interview
2518,2518,"amazing guy , he is a real role model"
2519,2519,"What a bad interviewer.

While Elon was expanding on complex and exciting engineering challenges, this guy kept coming back to sales and financials and commenting on unmet promises, expecting to poke and reveal stuff that might affect stock prices or investment on tesla in general."
2520,2520,Love you Elon!!!
2521,2521,Chris should learn to code then he'll understand the complexity and would be less interested in the predictions.
2522,2522,I love Elon.
2523,2523,Inspirational
2524,2524,There is a lot the world could learn from Elon Musk's revolutionary approaches to modern development of things via The New Human Social-Capital Innovation. An innovative system is a group of interrelated components working together towards a common goal I pioneered via ️ New Markets Business To Business To Customer Innovation: New Markets-B2B2C-i ️
2525,2525,"Don’t say we are a prototype, we understand that your interview partner is kind of a robot."
2526,2526,N-Link means no more VR controllers. Right on time. Next is cortical emulation and casting. Whats Latency for 500 pat.
2527,2527,Elon is the best!!!!!
2528,2528,️ Elon Musk is the Albert Einstein of our era!
2529,2529,"Elon doesn't need to explain us how he spends his money. It's not ours to even ask how it's going to be spent. And charity is not rocket science. Anyone with a bit of money can do charity. But there's only one Elon Musk. This future he envisions needs massive resources. Let him focus on doing the impossible, others can do the easy part; charity."
2530,2530,We live in era of Elon musk
2531,2531,One can become a worldleader by elections or just be born as one. Elons doings and saying is very important for many. He’s a great mind
2532,2532,Looks like Elon from the future talking to himself
2533,2533,"That's who you call, a great interviewer!!"
2534,2534,I am more impressed with how much Chris has learnt and changed over the years in not interrupting his interviewees.
2535,2535,Im curious...why cant we make electric rockets? Not that ive ever thought of it before but Elon says its not possible.
2536,2536,"what a human being Elon is, my goodness."
2537,2537,"i like elon, seems logical."
2538,2538,This man gives me good hopes for the future.
2539,2539,"Thank you for such a great interview. I only hope the interviewer wasn't as impatient as he was when he asked his questions and instead let Elon answer them fully before intervening,"
2540,2540,"Just give us the real unaltered pictures from Mars (not from bloody rovers). I mean we can watch stars light years away and cannot get real close ups of Moon or Mars? 
Give me a break!"
2541,2541,Glad to know that there is such a great man like Elon....he is awe insprining and hope he build schools and university so the world have more of him...
2542,2542,Elon 
2543,2543,What a great interviewer. Delightful to watch
2544,2544,Amazingly informative interview!
2545,2545,How mad do you think Elon is that the video wasn't released on 4/20?
2546,2546,"Great interview, Chris. Thank you."
2547,2547,Thanks a lot 
2548,2548,"i am not a fanboy of tesla but , after watching his last 2 interviews , i changed my mind i agree with him on free speech and i would like to support this man by supporting his products"
2549,2549,Thank you so much for this interview! 
2550,2550,This guys already living in 2050 in his head
2551,2551,No person on plant earth deserves more to be rich  then Him. He does everything in favour of humanity. Any independent thinking person knows it. As quite rightly he said everything he does is philantrophy. He's giving hope to humanity. We should thank for Elon to be given to us on every day basis.
2552,2552,47:40 we are like a small candle in a vast darkness.
2553,2553,"God bless Elon, what a wonderful human being, he is taking us from a type 0 civilization to a type 1 civilization. And he is only 1 man, what a privilege it is to be alive at this time in history to see him."
2554,2554,"As excited as I am to know that there is a future like this for humanity, I am concerned that mankind is not yet ready for such a fast paced technological evolution. 

For a first, it is really difficult to wrap your mind around all these technologies for an average mind, then there is an inherent barbaric nature of man to go to wars, the fast paced growth of AI is not yet regulated and there is a huge disparity in how these technologies are accessible to different parts of the world. For example, will the mars society be dominated by the US population, or will every country on earth have equal representation? How would they ensure harmony in such a diverse society (and deal with racism)?"
2555,2555,"He is so amazing...wow...so ME, ME, ME ME AND ME...."
2556,2556,"Great interview, thanks for this!"
2557,2557,TESLA to the moon. I bought 1 million dollars worth yesterday.
2558,2558,Excellent! May there be more Elons in this world.
2559,2559,"Just mindblowing what he is thinking about (such long term vision). 
Love You Elon"
2560,2560,Can Musk end all the wars? For the sake of any future......
2561,2561,"Algorithm should recommend this more to everyone if it isn't. 
Great talk. Learned so much. Not only the knowledge but also perspective."
2562,2562,"This man cannot project into the future but I can. It’s gonna be ok but it’s ok stocks will fall by 50% min more like 70%. His brain is still working, he is not Jesuit but he is right. But he is unsure so we need to decrease the stock value by 50% after all is ok his is our Brother wanting us to prosper."
2563,2563,I love that Chris brought up the hatred of Elon as billionaire from the left. He is the closest thing (or IS) to a hero against climate change and doing good for people as a whole. What a weird situation we are in where the left hates him and right loves him.
2564,2564,"I like Elon a lot, and I like many of the things he's doing, but the 3 things that I think we should all stop being so carelessly supportive of are 1. Neuro-link, 2. Self-driving cars, and 2. Mars colonization. I feel like all 3 of these ideas are profoundly terrible for different reasons."
2565,2565,He really believes
2566,2566,"Thank you Elon you give me hope for the future. The main stream media is hopeless, you are hopeful!!!!"
2567,2567,"lmfao ""I did promise the internet I'd make cat girls. We could make a robot cat girl."""
2568,2568,Every conversation Elon has goes down in history the moment it's released. We are watching history unfold live before us
2569,2569,Wow what an amazing ending. If you don't like Elon there's something wrong with you.
2570,2570,Remember when they said there would be an abundance of jobs when they offshored jobs to Mexico and China? Lol....
2571,2571,i like how he gave an inside into his net worth and how his personal use of these billions is next to nothing apart from driving his lifes work forward! great interview and another reason why im a lover of sci fi is that it gives hope of what we can achive
2572,2572,Elon is a actor
2573,2573,I love Elon Musk specially in this interview
2574,2574,The future is surely bright. The picture pointed by Elon about the future just gets you excited about the possibilities of this generation.
2575,2575,"Million dollars a minute to think, still tweets."
2576,2576,"An incredible human. I hope his kids all inherit his genius then
 I'll be very confident about our future."
2577,2577,Needs an Analog computer
2578,2578,Thank you Elon for you love for humanity
2579,2579,"Hearing these two men talk, is terrifying & exciting at the same time.  I grew up a Science Fiction freak in the 60s/70s. In 1969 after having lived through the Apollo 11 Moon Land which we watched on our small B&W TV screen, I decided that my high school project would have to focus on the Apollo mission.  I still have those exercise books, laden with newspaper/magazine articles/memorabilia, early computer printouts, pasted/sticky taped,  still intact. I wish I had done a more professional job of the project, but those where simple days."
2580,2580,Elon for President!
2581,2581,"Elon Musk ,we are only Lucky that someone as you exists in our time .The inspiration you share is mind boggling.The goodness you extend to the collective humanity is humbling .I pray that there is many of you -you multiplied.God speed!"
2582,2582,"@Elon instead of ""log curve"" u may say ""it looks like a bitcoin curve"", up&down&sideways since 2013 :D"
2583,2583,He is a great man - we should cherish him and hope there are more like him.
2584,2584,Amazing stuff. I was very pleased to learn it
2585,2585,Why am I the only one that already knew everything that was said by Elon? Why are all of you foaming at the mouth like you didn't know either?
2586,2586,"Think about the cost involved with assisted living, then think about the cost savings that could be available if there were a Tesla Optimus robot that was able to provide that care within your home."
2587,2587,I drive with my ears eyes and hands feet. My smell sometimes if something smells wrong. I take it easier.  How do you program the five senses in AI. No I don’t lick  the car lol.
2588,2588,"Mind-blowing and very eye-opening. He shows what optimism and desire for a better future are capable of. Problem-solving is a process filled with learning, growth and discoveries, and it is a path that, even when goals are not achieved, the growth that was attained helps us move forward in whole new ways. We all can learn from this mindset, and it's a really exciting way to live and relate to our world, instead of living by only focusing on ourselves. That excitement can give us tremendous energy to tackle new, bigger things in our lives and our world."
2589,2589,"Elon Musk has the right idea. 
If you want the new machines to be FOR You, 
They have to be of You."
2590,2590,Really grilled about his predictions.
2591,2591,"If I were a young man, I'd be trying to figure out how I could get a job with Elon Musk!  He sees the future, but also recognizes that there are secondary and tertiary consequences of any of his ideas.  Very rare in this upside down world run by ""progressives"" who wouldn't recognize ""progress"" if it bit them on the hiney."
2592,2592,If they have a UFO!  Suppose that the most possible is that you can travel.
2593,2593,"ELON, YOU ARE AN AMAZING HUMAN BEING, AND I WISH YOU ONLY HAPPINESS AND A SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT !!!
THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXAMPLE TO THE WORLD !!!"
2594,2594,I love this guy's optimism
2595,2595,Why can't electric power on it's own create some type of thrust?
2596,2596,"Elon Musk,  an absolute genius... Visionary"
2597,2597,People of Mars will watch this video before a revolution.
2598,2598,"This is both uplifting and terrifying. Musk is very smart, and has thought hard and deeply about some hugely important issues, including the transition to renewable energy. On these, he has been both substantively right, and has had a profoundly positive impact on human development. "
2599,2599,"Great Interview by Chris Anderson with EM...if you want the future to be good, you must make it so ! take actions...."
2600,2600,Elon for President !
2601,2601,"Top notch content, like the TED of old."
2602,2602,Why would someone spend a 100k to go to a different planet basically to suffer?
2603,2603,"Making people scared of the future this IS going to happen THAT is going to happen just programmes people to be scared - I love Elons mindset not enforcing it , just says yes we have to change but the more you worry about it the higher probability it would happen. Having an optimistic attitude is miles better and out of the box thinking to solve problems is the way forward."
2604,2604,"Great interview. Disagree with the 27:00 statement ""This will really be a world of abundance. It will be so cheap to have goods and services it will be ridiculous"". This won't probably be the case, particularly if some companies have the monopoly of production. Look at how PlayStation games just double their price when they started being sold digitally rather than physically."
2605,2605,This guy interrupts Elon musk every couple of seconds.. dude.. OMG let Elon finish what he's saying already....
2606,2606,I love Chris’ interview style and questions. He should moderate the next presidential debate
2607,2607,the aliens sending a sign with the light switching on/off at 48:49
2608,2608,very insightful. Elon may not have gotten everything right but you can tell he sincerely wants to make the world a better place and he has already done so especially with his strong force of employees across his companies. critics need to appreciate that and not just run their mouths
2609,2609,"Great interview. I find it interesting ""we're just monkey with a computer stuck in our brain."" The the frame blinks to reset thought process"
2610,2610,How I wish his Teslas were a little less expensive!
2611,2611,"The surrealism of watching this interview sitting in a trench in Ukraine with a Kalashnikov rifle is simply outrageous.  But it gives me confidence that by defending our freedom and destroying tyranny, humanity knows what to do next!  Elone, thank you from Ukraine!"
2612,2612,Exclusive interview by Elon Musk
2613,2613,"With men like him, the future looks brighter "
2614,2614,"Even though I like to watch YouTubers trying to make the world better, I think it won't change much. Well, at least watching their good intentions is fun. But we need new technology to really do that, something that changes the way we live, like the electric cars or the whole Hi-Tech factory. We knew the guy with inventiveness and irony, the only one who can do this."
2615,2615,why would we need to pull co2 out of our atmosphere? Cant we just plant more trees and if we reduce the output the balance will be restored automatically?
2616,2616,A great man with a good heart! God bless
2617,2617,Wow a first orbital Lauch attempt bullshot. Very cute this guy and the hair goes. The interviewer is really sinking and our friend is keeping his head up. Why? He is slave of Elon?
2618,2618,Elon Musk is the greatest entrepreneur of all times.
2619,2619,WE NEED TO PROTECT THIS MAN AT ALL COST!!!
2620,2620,We have no future with crazy weirdos in government. I would be more excited if you would purchase Fox news vs twitter. Put your money into educating humans to care for life. Talk is easy.
2621,2621,I wish more and more people feel same for the future of humanity rather than worrying about their social media presence........
2622,2622,"This is 6 minutes of window dressing and then a 1 hour infomercial on Musk and his pet projects. Come on, TED. Quit highlighting the modern robber barons who rely on real innovators to do the work then take the credit and profits."
2623,2623,In the age of abundance where we can have more goods that cost less I'm alarmed that the dangers of using up our finite resources is not mentioned as a negative.
2624,2624,Meanwhile I believe in a lot of his talking points. Consumerism is a HUGE problem. We can't buy ourselves out of the problem.
2625,2625,The EPA is putting the brakes on SpaceX for a few acres of mud in a gulf where almost 1850 oil drilling rigs exist.
2626,2626,What an amazing individual!
2627,2627,"Maybe the pentagon will have it, for more information ask them!"
2628,2628,My main concern with Neuralink is whether we will be able to turn it off at will.
2629,2629,What Musk needs to realise & acknowledge is that the road network evolved from horse drawn vehicles and suited that mode of transport. The advent of the automobile has simply been superimposed on that model. Self drive will ultimately be skyward. Secondly I have been working with AI since before he was born and the conclusion I reached is that non rigid software is possible but as an example it needs to be looked at in a similar way to human brain function. Human brain function is completely non rigid and in general performs consistently up to say 98-99%. It is that small percentage of deviation that is the problem. I & my company developed several on board systems that incorporated a modicum of AI & the Boeing Max is a typical example of poor understanding of software algorithms and development in the context of my above narrative. Thirdly he is partially right wrt to the 'Future equation'. My definition as at 2001 was 'Energy -Water-Food' using the oceans as the first building block.
2630,2630,I’ve never met a person that has earned the right to extend their lifespan. If you’re ready for neural link then you don’t deserve the real world. Pure transhumanist propaganda.
2631,2631,I’m amazed at so many positive comments on here about Elon.  That’s great!  I guess TED does bring a more sane audience.
2632,2632,4/20 and currently at 69k likes. Nice!
2633,2633,I hope that in 1000 years future historians living all over the solar system will wish they had been alive at the same time as Elon Musk
2634,2634,"46:38 Just loved listening to his 'Mars Sales Pitch' and already the existential crisis in the 21 century mind cries.. 
SURE I AM IN PIECE A CAKE, SO WHEN DO WE GO ! "
2635,2635,If a new battery is invented that’s why better.
2636,2636,"FSD is like creating digital twin of Human itself (eyes & neurons), and I'd imagine it's really difficult to predict Human behavior better than 40% (coz all sorts of funny & unpredictable things human can do)"
2637,2637,All I know is my log curve ideas are not in your solution set. Might work better. But this dang day job is keeping me from it. lol
2638,2638,Pure Inspiration!
2639,2639,Good man. It's good to know he has good intentions
2640,2640,isn't tesla changing to hydrogen?
2641,2641,Love Elon so much 
2642,2642,Just stock manipulate like he does breaking the law to make more money.
2643,2643,Thanks Elon keep it up :)
2644,2644,An absolute visionary
2645,2645,"Words are cheap, and Elon's actions don't follow his words."
2646,2646,"Very inspiring  interview! Get There Action to make the future  Civilization , Humanity better ! …. Mars is our next  earth !!!"
2647,2647,"first 5 secs
""Great, how are you?""
ignores and proceeds to next topic"
2648,2648,A pure futurist who actually wants to make the world better. So refreshing!
2649,2649,It seems like he is personally being made responsible for the future. That’s got to feel so heavy.
2650,2650,he is one of the best philanthropist and Elizabeth Warren isn't an Indian so just be quiet Elizabeth
2651,2651,Incredibly inspirational
2652,2652,Deus Ex the PC Games will become a reality in maxim 50 years. The begging I mean. Some of us will not live to see how the world will evolve beyond 2075 towards the end on the century. But those who will be alive they will see those things happening. The Human Augmentation Project will be  great thing with all the goods and the bad.
2653,2653,"Ok, you've got to be a channel of over 20m subscribers to be able to have 1 hr of Elon Musk's life ️"
2654,2654,"You don't gotta agree with his morals. You don't have to love the guy...but to actively work against him, or to hate the man---  is just ludicrous... no other public figure on  offers as much optimism of the future as Elon Musk. We NEED what he offers"
2655,2655,️ I am cautiously optimistic
2656,2656,If you're a true environmentalist you should support this man
2657,2657,"A world of abundance will create a shrinking populations, further accelerating abundance."
2658,2658,"Yessss! Elon rocks! I honestly don't get, how people could still doubt his intentions."
2659,2659,"Elon never talks about all the energy it will take to mine the earthen materials needed for the production of batteries, windmills and solar panels, etc. Some inventors get stuck in the mode of inventing and not think about the whole story."
2660,2660,"*Everyone who reads this, we don't know each other and probably never will but I wish you all the best in life and all the luck in the world.*......."
2661,2661,What a great man.   There 1500 haters disliking this video.  Amazing.
2662,2662,Glad Elon is not with the Doomsday people!!!!
2663,2663,Elon may not be feeling the effects of climate disruption but others certainly are
2664,2664,"I'm glad to live in the Age of Elon. My name will not be remembered but I can say ""I was here"""
2665,2665,Low cost energy? The amount of materials needed for wind mills and solar panels and batteries are astronomical. It is not sustainable at all!
2666,2666,Watching them seethe impotently about this guy is a joy.
2667,2667,"about FSD vehicules, its useless if only Tesla has it... everycar should have FSD, otherwise you are on the road, with Tesla FSD version 1.0.0 final release, then somebody with a ford crash into you... whatever your FSD system you dead... the risks will be others now..."

2669,2669,"The most sad thing about everything Elon will do in the future is : only a small about of people will really benefit from everything....The very rich people will have a quite dif future while the poor people are going to die of starvation ..... sounds like a movie I've already seen. The future looks good from he's perspective .... i will had and i think anybody will had the same tough being ""The most rich man of earth"""
2670,2670,"The future is lithium, and lithium mining. Alot of mining. Because this is profitable for the few. Stand with Djokovic against Rio Tinto."

2672,2672,"We are, in fact, not on a good track, our nation is divided and we are poor... talk about out of touch xD"
2673,2673,"Neuro Link and Elon Musk, gives me hope for the future. I only hope I get the extreme honor to be successfully upgraded via Neuro Link or something just like it. Run Nano threading and graphene throughout the entire structure of EVs to turn them into a big battery that lasts for a very long time. No more batteries or plugging in. Especially if you super charge them by having a direct connect to the axle of EVs and solar."
2674,2674,This man looks like a different person every time we see him. 
2675,2675,"We need to change our life style and stop our large consumerism of products and foods. Eat food that is in season in your area, walk or cycle to your shop, grow your own food.

2683,2683,Best Musk interview.
2684,2684,He’s so dedicated to that good future that he lobbied to kill a bill that would have been our greatest effort yet to combat climate change.  Because it benefited his competition...
2685,2685,Nice
2686,2686,"This guy and the team he’s building are putting similar efforts, with far less funding, into improving things for the many that our defence industries across the globe, funded by our taxes through our various governments are spending trying to destroy as many of us as they believe is necessary to impose their chosen system of control on as many as possible. Just imagine what we could do with that effort and funding directed at improving health and life outcomes for all of us."

2689,2689,I wish that this video reaches those people who have some suicidal thought or depression and wants to end their life. This video of Elon that all they need to aspire to live longer and witness this exciting future. It gives hope...

2693,2693,Can anyone describe the importance of Elon for humanity without bursting into tears ?
2694,2694,The most important video ever. He just showed us map to humanity’s destiny.
2695,2695,He is definition of MISERABLE
2696,2696,"If you’re lucky enough to be reading this, take a minute to express gratitude  not only is it a great practice for health, but we’re living through the most innovative times in human history, alongside one of the greatest innovators to ever walk the earth. "
2697,2697,What is a Hindenburg moment? 52:00
2698,2698,How can one man be the world's leading expert on so many things. They are just switching from one topic to another like its nothing.

2700,2700,"He must fight not ask so many questions,"
2701,2701,I wonder what Roger Schank thinks about Elon's claims on driverless cars & advances in AI. He is probably rolling his eyes.
2702,2702,"But they are really Christians, they love Jesus above all things, if it really is like that and they prove it to me with facts, soon it will be possible to travel!"
2703,2703,"The fact is that new enovation will almost always create more jobs. The problem is that often older folks haven't been retrained and thus become redundant. The real problem here is business greed, it's easier to use a younger person that already knows the new tech than retraining an older person who anyway might only be on the jobmarket for another ten years. Basically because humans mostly only value other humans as income generators or cash cows, if you don't make me money you're useless and not worthy of being."
2704,2704,I could listen to Elon explain how paint dries and I would be interested
2705,2705,Can I get a job at the giga factory  
2706,2706,Elon is the last best hope for the future.
2707,2707,"Suggest looking up ""Blind-sight"" implications"
2708,2708,Amazing 
2709,2709,I just wonder what would happen if an AI car drives towards a big mirror.
2710,2710,"24:32 : ungodly.  God created human beings, not robots.
Be careful what you promise the internet.  

But God’s truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and “All who belong to the Lord must turn away from evil.” Run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts. Instead, pursue righteous living, faithfulness, love, and peace. Enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts. Again I say, don’t get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights. A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people’s hearts, and they will learn the truth."
2711,2711,Take a non uniform magnetic field. And a gyro type spinning device.   Have a magnet on the outside pulling the one In (non equal force due to messing with the field) now it basically gives energy the same way as a steam engine. Spinning and powering.  And has 0 cost.  Heck if applied in space or non friction environments like the new floating trains that means we could even break the speed of light eventually .
2712,2712,i was wondering if Elon Musk coud unite with playstation with his ai develpment to compete with Bil gates and microsoft......???
2713,2713,@26:20 the robot is never going to be a one-time payment. Everything is sold as a service now with annual or monthly payments. I imagine that this would be the same.
2714,2714,Trump said it in a interview Elon is a national treasure....thus guy's mind is brilliant..
2715,2715,he just lost 60 million dollars
2716,2716,"Great opportunity to interview one of the most innovative people of the century, hampered by a bad interviewer. There was so many things to explore in this 1 hour opportunity but wasted time on nonsensical foolishness."

2718,2718,Thorium nuclear power deserves more credit than it gets.
2719,2719,"I think your switcher board may be failing. Some of the transition shots had a lag that almost looked like a slow to open iris. At first I thought it was a camera issue because it happened twice on Elon's close up shot, but then it also happened with one of Chris' shots leading me to believe the fade/transition time on the board is failing or there's an intermittent signal path issue somewhere."

2723,2723,G D bless you Elon. Take care of yourself we can't afford to lose you.
2724,2724,Elon needs to capitalise on the Robots   not sell them but lease them out as a work force 
2725,2725,"Please, just no."
2726,2726,One Elon Musk is by far more valuable to humanity than all politicians worldwide.
2727,2727,Pay taxes. Simple.
2728,2728,"Elon musk looks like he has aged in recent times, the stress might have got to his head."
2729,2729,We don't need more people if we create robots to do the work of half the population. More people means more consumption of resources. Hope someone asks him this question
2730,2730,Cant wait for cat girls
2731,2731,can someone please ask him what he thinks the optimal population of humans is? and to elaborate more on the risk as he sees it?
2732,2732,He sounds like a marble mouth
2733,2733,THIS is the internet I signed up for . Good morning world !
2734,2734,Elon Musk is the Nicola Tesla of our time....
2735,2735,I WISH I COULD AVOID HEARING THIS GRIFTER'S BULLSHIT FOR A SINGLE DAY
2736,2736,Elon just casually explaining how he'll make pod-racing safe for children by inventing a C-3PO/R2-D2 AI.
2737,2737,Is that Jesus there ????
2738,2738,I 100% agree about the simple Laws Made that are no 20 pages and open ended to interpretation.
2739,2739,the argument of being a multi planet species is a LOT different than setting up colonies on space rocks.    Colonies dont survive after mother planets are destroyed so its not a real mechanism to save humanity unless you figure out how to travel at the speed of light and make it to another earth like planet.
2740,2740,"Elon, but I am the führer already . How much money you have."
2741,2741,"If you have ever taken a large dose of psilocybin in a dark room, you may have encountered a sense of technological positivism by the visual inward experience of mankind's potentials. The gospel in all of this, and it seems frequent in the psilocybin experience, is that there is always a better, more efficient way to apply technology. Technology is a tool and it would be unwise for man to attach himself too much to one version of that potential. We can always do better and we do not have to be negative about it to strive forward. Progress is the human game no matter how pessimistic you may find yourself."
2742,2742,@22:07 a mistake.
2743,2743,Would need a temper-proof ROM that self-destructs if tempered with in those robots to make it more difficult to physically hack robots in case a hacker tried to remove the original chip and install a hacked ROM chip.
2744,2744,The future is fewer personal vehicles. Electric cars are better than traditional cars but we need fewer cars on the roads. Take everything you hear from this man with a grain of salt. He is the richest man in the world for a reason and the endeavors to produce more electric cars will destroy the world through rare element mining operations
2745,2745,Bullshit Never ie Never Elon
2746,2746,They're already using implants in brains to help things like Parkinsons and Eplilepsy (Medtronics) with discussions about its applications for schizophrenia and depression dating back at least 2 decades ago. So what he's suggesting in terms of wires and implants is not far fetched at all.

2749,2749,"If you give complete attention there is no time, there is no wastage of energy. Imagination builds the image of the self and thought then functions within its shadows. From this self-concept grows the conflict between what is and what should be, the conflict in duality."

2753,2753,"The future is bright , glowing in the dark even.A better future , underground."
2754,2754,Musk and I have so much in common. We both dont own a house and cut our own hair!
2755,2755,Yeah elon musk most overrated person atm... NOT a hater but also not a fanboy. Still waiting for his Hyperloop which defo never gonna work. And i think his thousands of sats he wants to put in the sky are an absolut garbage idea and not needed at all..also tesla another luxury car brand.. Atleast it brought the whole car market a bit forward into e-cars. But on the other side of things all this products and ideas are from yesterday and absolutly not for the future.. And i think people cant or want see it. Cars for example are not the future of transportation even if all cars become e-cars.. Just the resource problem should make you think.. But make em belief in your old future ideas is the way elon goes and millions follow him.
2756,2756,"That's such an important statement that he is not consuming personally large amounts of money, and if he did, the criticism from the left would be justified. Let's tax extreme luxury items progressively and not wealth increase, which has far more positive effects than negative."
2757,2757,No AI will be anything close to a human being.  Fast moving vehicles needs human intervention or it was just become a killing machines.
2758,2758,"Give money to a non profit company and you feed it for a day, make a philanthropic company profitable and it will keep doing good for decades."
2759,2759,Great interview but  the questioner would ask a question then before Musk could answer he would show he was dying to ask another before the answer was given. That was distracting.
2760,2760,MAKE EYE CONTACT JEEZE
2761,2761,Interviewer wasn't allowing Elon to go as much as  deep into his answers.
2762,2762,ELON MASK KINDLY REPLY TO MY MSGS
2763,2763,"Elon, why don't you create a volunteer program for mars? I am sure a lot of people would like to join such a thing"
2764,2764,I don't get why Elon get a lot of hate
2765,2765,28:00
2766,2766,"The things Elon talks about sounds really promising and cool. But can you imagine how much all those BILLIONS of dollars to buy Twitter could help the struggeling people, the poor, the ill, the physically/psychically impeired people, no matter who you are."
2767,2767,"The planet has been dieing since the fall of man.  As a world, it's impossible to put our pride aside.  Thank you Jesus for hope."
2768,2768,Wish USA still be the country that allows people like Elon to flourish.
2769,2769,Thanks Elon and Ted
2770,2770,Pfft for some maybe ...
2771,2771,I counted nine times that the interviewer cut Elon off midsentence
2772,2772,Sales Pitch
2773,2773,He's a God scion.
2774,2774,"These are 2 men, one trying to ask questions in an attractive compelling way, the other trying to answer in an ethereal an captivating way. This is theater. I'm done with the theater. The individual needs needs to do the best he/she can to be as efficient as possible day to day, the end."
2775,2775,Human version 1.0. Elon is the prototype of how we should all be
2776,2776,What is the COLLECTIVE HUMAN WILL according to Musk???
2777,2777,Fantastic Interview!
2778,2778,"I don’t get how people hate on Elon. The other billionaires dodge tax, screw their employees and live in luxury, Musk doesn’t . Elon works tirelessly to make the world a better place, gave 15 billion to charity this year. The things he’s achieved with SpaceX and Tesla already are game changing. Musk is the earth’s MVP IMO."
2779,2779,"Income inequality is a big reason why life sucks for many of us. Too many Elons who are keeping it all for themselves instead of working for the common good, like this one.

And, THIS Elon could do more for his workforce. That would be great."
2780,2780,Clearly Elon didn’t watch Smarthouse when he was younger 
2781,2781,Hey Elon I thought you did a great job playing the villain in the new Freaky Creatures and Where to Catch Them movie.
2782,2782,he is a great person
2783,2783,Our Saviour has spoken !!
2784,2784,I can’t take Elon serious anymore because of the whole Twitter ordeal. He lost focus
2785,2785,"in a world where nearly everything can be delivered to your doorstep or desktop, why are we still trying to cram people into public transportation to nowhere?  I feel like people who work in public transportation/govt are some of the only people not working remotely and have the least progressive views."
2786,2786,"The number of things they did not talk about that are problems created by Elon’s future is astounding.  For example, what do you do with the millions of service industry workers displaced by AI.  Also, what about the problems with fast and slow charging of batteries and the environmental costs associated with mining of battery source material and disposal/recycling.  What a short-sited interview.  This was a sales pitch with an uneducated interviewer.  Have an engineer do this interview and you will get a much more realistic picture for the future."
2787,2787,Love you Elon…………..God Bless from Australia ️🇦🇺️️
2788,2788,No matter how much I respect Elon and enjoyed this conversation I will not be subscribing to TED talks -- they ban as much as twitter. Rupert Sheldrake for one.
2789,2789,you can have the rocket attached to a rail on a vertical maglev on the side of a mountain perhaps? how much fuel will that save?
2790,2790,Amazing . 
2791,2791,"This interviewer is not listening and digest what Elon is saying. Every time Elon finishes sentence he's just pushing with the next question like a kid attacking dad with another question. WTH, chill out mate. Take it easy"
2792,2792,Elon is a hero
2793,2793,"What a fantastic interview, well worth the watch."
2794,2794,"A very well conducted interview.  Pointed questions on numerous topics which allowed the guest enough time to flesh out his ideas, counter arguments and predictions.  Thank you."
2795,2795,Sir elon mask is God of earth
2796,2796,Listening to Elon Musk vision for going to Mars has revived my optimistic view for the future. I used look forward to how to technology advances but stopped because many were focused on the right now instead of the future.
2797,2797,I wonder what the climate is like on Elon's home planet..
2798,2798,Full of information and great interview ️
2799,2799,Impressive! Amazing interview. Make it happens Elon.
2800,2800,Of course we simply use saltwater in batteries where waste is fresh water; fresh water from a saltwater battery what an invention!
2801,2801,"Great and inspiring interview, thank you!"
2802,2802,"Nice
We want to see Warren Buffet sir"
2803,2803,I can listen to Elon musk forever. But the questions where really good as well. Thanks for this awesome interview. Especially after the live one which was crazy and crazy good 
2804,2804,"Beautiful interview with a beautiful ending "" If you want a beautiful future then try your hardest to make one""."
2805,2805,"Without taking away from all the good work, what will be the climate impact of launching 1000 chemical rockets in a short time span"
2806,2806,We need to support Elon. The man!!!
2807,2807,I ALWAYS had TO MUCH ENERGY SO I'M  looking  new things to do to   channel the energy
2808,2808,One of the best interviews with Elon I’ve seen!
2809,2809,Great interview Chris. When the subject of low birth rate was mentioned I wanted you to ask Elon if he sees the robots Tesla is developing as being able to supplant the declining population?
2810,2810,The government has to sign off on it but will only do it when they are ready.
2811,2811,"Bar none, the best interview with Elon until April of 2022. Thanks, Chris! Thanks, Elon!"
2812,2812,Elon for global basic income in the near future .
2813,2813,"Thanks for sharing this interview Chris, really appreciate it"
2814,2814,This man is full hopes and better future. Thank you Elon.
2815,2815,Elon slowly turns into Mr Robotnik
2816,2816,Thank you Elon!! You give me hope daily. 
2817,2817,Check eyes of Elon and the interviewer!
2818,2818,You can see his hearts in the rite place... when he talked about his heros in space it was powerful for me
2819,2819,"Love as been, is and will always be the answer to all of our problems, spiritual intelligence and technologies follow. Merci Elon for driving this force of Love now and towards the future."
2820,2820,Love all the haters of tesla and Elon. Keep doubting him you fools!
2821,2821,"Hear, hear! Thank you, Elon, for all that you have done, and all that you are doing. Don’t forget that joy and gratitude are among the most precious qualities that consciousness adds to an insensible universe, so it’s worth your time to experience them. Consider it an important part of your daily work. You owe it to the shareholders. ; - }"
2822,2822,2 million views in 2 days... impressive!
2823,2823,"I’m halfway in, and I must compliment the interviewer. He had done his homework. "
2824,2824,Elon is right that we should differentiate consumption and owning assets. If one is not using his assets to sell them and use the money for careless consumption then it should be criticized.
2825,2825,"Who wants telepathy with their ""loved one""? Jesus.. there wouldn't be a single relationship on earth. Thoughts are meant to be private, let's keep it that way."
2826,2826,"Thanks Chris, good questions and interesting conversation!"
2827,2827,"Future is, 
When there is no human waste,
 On any other planet."
2828,2828,Thank you for this interview with our man Elon Musk !
2829,2829,"""if you want the future to be good make it so"" - Elon Musk"
2830,2830,"You can’t really predict The doomsday. Yes, the nature is getting bad coz of us - human. But, you can’t say for majority people that future is not going to be great or promised. 
You don’t have the same view, dreams, goals, understanding of the life, soul and so on…"
2831,2831,Thank you for making this available on YouTube!
2832,2832,"He’s pro nuclear, we all should be"
2833,2833,This was a great listen. Thank you for this.
2834,2834,The interviewer brought great questions. Thank you for this video.
2835,2835,"You guys had almost 10 years of hyperloop fantasy , now you want to go through bs fantasy of Mars."
2836,2836,One of the best interview 
2837,2837,"Somewhere there are Tesla sweatshops, where people are labelling video segments. Welcome to the modern dystopian disparity between the haves and the have-nots."
2838,2838,"Imagine a world where all millionaires and billionaires thought like this, I’ve watched the climate crisis for 20 years, implemented regenerative agriculture to be the change I want to see (and showcase for others) and this is the first time I have felt optimistic about the future. Those in power all around the world…heed Elons words. The future is bright despite your petty political bulls*;t. To all of humanity…power rests with us, our vote, our dollars, our choices - be part of the solution. X"
2839,2839,"Every single human's quality of life is now, and shall in the near term, be made better by following the example set by people like Elon.

I believe in his philanthropic enterprises whole heartily. I wish Elon Musk a long life. I hope he has every possible opportunity to continue being a net positive force for real, global, evolution."
2840,2840,"A brilliant man yes. But How much (Fossil Fuel) energy is used to mine the elements to produce batteries?
Solar and Wind are not reliable, and will never totally supply all energy. We must use fossil fuels, he should focus on carbon capture and clean fossil fuel energy"
2841,2841,Being able to finish 90% of Elon' statements perfectly in my head is Fing satisfying
2842,2842,Who remembers the cartoon The Jetsons? Was that just a cartoon or was it Elon Musks future before he was born?
2843,2843,"Cities with ""challenging"" roads will become easier to solve as their road networks develop. Part of matching robotaxi capability to location will be making the roads easier."
2844,2844,"To interview Elon you have to be smart, thanks Ted thanks Chris"
2845,2845,Reason for low birth rates in the developed world? Housing costs. Educational debt. Reduce these two dramatically and people will have the confidence to afford children.
2846,2846,His eyes says everything about him. This man is unique and rare genius
2847,2847,"“Real-world (artificial) intelligence & scaled-up manufacturing, things Tesla is very good at…..no question, this will be more important than the car”.

If he’s successful, he might be right. Though I have a horrible feeling we’re about to really appreciate how vital the private ICE vehicle is to American families. Gas shortages are occurring intermittently in Europe. While in large part, I think they’re deliberately induced, they’re being made to happen quite deliberately. They’re getting the citizens used to constraints on freedoms. It’s all but impossible to manage an ordinary life in the US, without access to a private car, unless you live in a big city, like NY, where almost everything you need & want is accessible via a subway or cab ride. Once you’re outside that super privileged environment, nothing happens without an ICE car. "
2848,2848,Watching him try to do anything makes me feel better about myself.
2849,2849,what an amazing interview
2850,2850,AI is analogic not digital!
2851,2851,This man makes me proud to be human!
2852,2852,"@ElonMusk what bout free energy with generators? In Texas and Mexico, they are already running 1  - 10 MW"
2853,2853,Amazing podcast. So many good pointers
2854,2854,As always I say Wow just wow. To be able to talk to him and ask him questions and to be able to experience him as he’s giving his answers would be awesome. He’s passionate about so many things…his brain must want to explode with all his ideas. He must have so much that he can’t even get it out fast enough. What God has endowed him with is awesome and amazing. I love the way he answers and thinks….man just to talk to him lol to follow him through his day…and I live in Texas lol not to far from Austin 
2855,2855,OMG! Tesla brain implant this year!
2856,2856,“A lot of people are sad about the future…..pessimistic….which is not great” - Elon Musk
2857,2857,"Advice to all you young, old, black, white, whatever! In america you don have to be great to start, but you must start in order to be great.. its that simple. Peace and love from NC"
2858,2858,I hope that the world is going to look like the way Elon is describing and that progress won't be slowed down or stopped by ignorance or unfounded fears
2859,2859,Beautiful interview
2860,2860,so what about the hyperloop and self driving taxis earning 30k?
2861,2861,"With all the tremendous resources at his disposal, why doesn't Elon have a team working on the problem of antigravity propulsion? Combustion engines are primitive. Once you've got antigravity drives, so many transportation problems are instantly solved. It's more profound than moving from sailing ships to nuclear powered ships."
2862,2862,Take a loan out for Mars then never pay it back because you’re on another planet
2863,2863,"One thing about Elon Musk is he is very interesting, you want to listen to what he has to say, even if you  don't believe everything he is saying."
2864,2864,I hope he has the best bodyguards and security. I hope greedy people who controls fuel industry won't ruin our future and let him do what he does best.
2865,2865,I would go to mars but I’m 18 with $0 to my name 
2866,2866,"Interesting to see the majority of people betting all of their hopes on technological optimism and idolizing capitalist oligarchies (or ""techno-feudalists"") like Elon Musk (rather than having faith of ordinary people organizing themselves making ""real"" change of society)."
2867,2867,"i could expand so much, but simply put? supply and demand for goods and services while the supply chain is dead af and builders sit waiting for building supplies hence basically out of work?"
2868,2868,"In a world that is so bloody negative all the time, AMEN for this man."
2869,2869,"There are multi-media artists, and so many people are multi-skilled - engineers I guess.  Using parts from different areas is a great idea with refinement and probably time good things could come."
2870,2870,"""almost anyone can have 100k dollars"" this dude is seriously detached from reality"
2871,2871,"4 years ago when I was in the college, my Transportation System’s professor have assigned us a project and throughout that project, we conclude that base on number, in 2050, people will move to sustainable energy such as EV & battery. At that time, tesla is around 180 before split.  Now it is worth 5000 before split"
2872,2872,Tunnel into the moon and make a moon base please elon
2873,2873,"Harnessing the gravitational pull of the earth is next level electricity production, a New Zealand man figured this out and offered to sell his technological advances but has since passed away with that knowledge."
2874,2874,51:20 that's got to be the understatement of the year. And he says it so casually xD
2875,2875,The moon. Good stuff
2876,2876,"If we spent the same energy and resources on love rather than war, it’d be cheaper and we’d all be so much further ahead in achieving peace amongst others and ourselves. World peace."
2877,2877,Wow was Ted always scams and nonsense? or just making an exception for Elon?
2878,2878,This gentleman brings back hope for humanity.
2879,2879,The level of thinking that Elon have so much ahead
2880,2880,'The next launch to mars will hopefully suck less than Fyre Island'.  Elon
2881,2881,A few times Elon references Solar and Wind as contributing to the energy future... I wonder when we can see a @Tesla residential wind solution
2882,2882,"Who’s going to point out that soft, vulnerable human bodies cannot be protected while transiting Earth to Mars."
2883,2883,Elon is fn awesome wish I can meet him.
2884,2884,"'SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, Boring Company are philantrophy'.. havent seen anyone use their money for the sake of humanity more wisely than Elon. Wonderful interview!"
2885,2885,I beleive that the best technology must be occupied in creating synthetic melanin...
2886,2886,"Ted asked: What view to talk to whole generation？they are very disappointed.
Elon's answer: Take action to make it good.
simple and powerful answer."
2887,2887,cant wait for the interview when tesla stocks crash
2888,2888,We should also add factory farming as a significant concern. We need to move towards more of a plant-based diet.
2889,2889,Together we are this future! 
2890,2890,"Idk social media should be used for something more important than showing ourselves and our lives and faking it like what’s the point to do that if u know you don’t need to do that.
We can use social media for careers creativity informations for a professional knowledge.
Entertainment is an addiction today and it’s damaging our brains and we don’t even know it, i can’t go 10 mins without entertainment if i don’t have a reminder or a timer for SM i’ll forget to take care of myself and the people around me and it makes no sense to worship the internet "
2891,2891,This was a PR piece if I ever saw one but I like Elon and respect what he’s trying to do.
2892,2892,We need to please I have a complete design that I can build with my ELITE contractors. I'm a just as you and Robert Downey Jr.
2893,2893,"That Optimus project has I,Robot vibes "
2894,2894,"He is right about population collapse and people should understand it


'' I'm trying to set a good example because the birthrate on Earth is so low that we are facing civilizational collapse unless the birth rate returns to a sustainable level. [...]Population collapse is one of the biggest threats to the future of human civilization and that is what is going on right now. ''                                        -Elon Musk"
2895,2895,"Better than any prophet, just take action."
2896,2896,"An hour seems too little, the man has got a lot to say."
2897,2897,Swapping fossil fuels for electro-magnetic pollution?
2898,2898,The interviewer is like old Elon asking younger Elon if he knows what his about!
2899,2899,Thanks for uploading this!!  was bummed that it was initially subscription only
2900,2900,A fuckin genious
2901,2901,"Next time I play Life, I'm going to choose Elon as my character."
2902,2902,thorium generators. wireless charging on moon. tidal energy. Neuro network of self actuated power towers. clouds.
2903,2903,Engineering automated solar and wind powered factories that can be built anywhere would be a good start. We still don't know enough about biology outside the Goldilocks zone.
2904,2904,"Regardless of what the world is going through, better to listen hope from elon musk about the future than anything"
2905,2905,"solar, wind and batteries require a stupid amount of manpower, material and maintnance, doesnt make much sense when using the world ''sustainable'', as the more production you get from thoses, the least sustainable the maintance and material costs becomes. Nuclear all the way."
2906,2906,"Oh please, please, let Elon talk as much as possible, I can't get enough to see his mind yet."
2907,2907,The Matrix... what's that machines did? They turned humans in batteries and offers them instead a fake life. Cool solution! :)))
2908,2908,"Easy - get general AI onboard, functional, and then task it with developing a neuro-link.  It would probably take it days, rather than humans fumbling for decades. Same goes for interstellar travel, colonization and a slew of other problems facing mankind.  AI will be the answer."
2909,2909,very nice thank you as always ted
2910,2910,"Elon: go make babies
me: yes sir!"
2911,2911,Life in orbit and at low-gravity bodies (i.e. asteroids) is important to normalize at them same time as colonizing Mars.

2917,2917,Exciting
2918,2918,"I hope our government protects this man for we would be poorer without him.. He should have the same or better protection than our president.  He's the Thomas Edison of our time.  Maybe he's not an alien,  but instead Devine.   He's remarkable."
2919,2919,"So is that 10% of 300tWh Elon is aiming for? Chris mistakingly said 0.1tWh was 1/100th of the total needed, instead of 1/3000th"
2920,2920,Not if the WEF has anything to say about it.
2921,2921,"Great interview. The only thing that threw me a bit was him saying they’d like to do human trials with neuralink this year… idk about you, but the outcomes of those primate trials didn’t sound too positive to me lol"
2922,2922,why dont all billionares share 1 million per person on the world to promote the market and to go against poverty!
2923,2923,Amazing 
2924,2924,"On the starship,,  i really want to know what elon intends to do as for alloys in the construction of the production version of starship,, 304 stainless is prone to vibration cracking and while it should be fine for development builds i cant see that it will be suitable for long term use,, I am sure Elon has already thought this through, but as a lifetime stainless fabricator that has worked at biotech level,  I am interested to know if there is a material change for production,,  and honestly I would love to work on starship,, give me a call,,"
2925,2925,Robot catgirl?! I'm down!
2926,2926,"Does Elon push time, not by changing time, but getting good people together and working fast and cleverly."
2927,2927,Being given ridiculous hypothetical scenarios and being expected to reply is a feminine ploy to trap the unwise.
2928,2928,"First time I’ve heard Elon do an impression, he also didn’t stutter once while doing so…"
2929,2929,"So Elon is good with nuclear energy and that's great. So Mr. Musk, any genius concept for ridding earth of the enormous industrial waste?"
2930,2930,Thanks.
2931,2931,"Humans are the best organic robots so far.. and you know the story, what happens next…"
2932,2932,So he isn’t a doomsday guy anymore? when did he flip his flop?
2933,2933,"51:42   That's the thing: you can just park and accumulate rocket fuel in orbit, and you don't have to pay rent for it! You can sell it, use it, leave it. Its gold."
2934,2934,"58:05 It would be interesting to have a vlogging type video ""one day in the life of Elon Musk""."
2935,2935,"""A future Net worth to get excited about"" you mean"
2936,2936,"Right now we're in the in between times, in 20 years the world is going to be very different, AI or computer controlled things with a simple touch of your phone. Eventually we're going to have ai drivers and electric vehicles be at least be as common at the gas car. There are already robots delivering things to homes in select areas, this is only going to grow."
2937,2937,Abundance? What about SOIL?
2938,2938,Watching this very reluctantly but I’ll keep an open mind for the duration of the interview at least…
2939,2939,a thousand ships every 2 years each with 100 people so sending a half million people every year sounds like astronaut is going to become a much more accessible job
2940,2940,"Don't ever give our city mars plans, please I will be able to bring a a whole city to Mars I have the air quality ,water filtration,pure oxygen , hydro power, and nuclear is it and silver I have a complete community at scale and even a train that will travel to all must have areas along with green house I am a great bud tender and a health cure for cancer diabetes and aids, I have a unique blood type that you will be my real life changes. Eli musk let me to meet you and I will allow you all the credit I just need your help to make even a fish pond of talipia,or cat fish, I want the moon to be a great amazement and we can have every one saying wow this is why we need  real Al me ."
2941,2941,"When we talk about the future let’s start by talking about eliminating student debt. Everyone says students are supposed to be the future of humanity, but they shackle them with debt before they go out into the world. Who shackles their own future? SMH"
2942,2942,Can the interviewer stop interrupting and talking over who he’s interviewing pls? Ffs
2943,2943,"10:00 False dawn's, series of tailing off log curves, local maxima.

2944,2944,No matter what he says. Do not let this man die soon.
2945,2945,tri motor cyber truck that's my future
2946,2946,Can we all collectively tweet Elon Musk to start a new project to solve the world’s trash problem?
2947,2947,the plot of the day after tomorrow is tru
2948,2948,"The interviewer is confusing, like many, CAPACITY and (annual) PRODUCTION. 

Tesla's estimate is 300TWh of total installed energy capacity. This means, if we (the entire world) can produce 15TWh per year, it would take 20 years to reach this number. 15TWh IS possible. "
2949,2949,I'm so excited for the Mars chapter to begin.
2950,2950,Having children is too expensive
2951,2951,Elon seems healthier. Looks like he finally got some sleep. 
2952,2952,What happened to the old hairstyle? Good thing he is smart… and rich… ;  )
2953,2953,"1:03:35 people will always talk and say bad things, especially if they are envious of someone status or accomplishments, but you shouldn't consider what they are saying unless:
a) they are a close one  and know you well)
b) you specifically asked for their opinion"
2954,2954,Chris Anderson is an excellent interrogator/interviewer......
2955,2955,"""My prediction"". Ukraine-Russia war. Russia n Ukraine: wheat exports. Belarus n Russia: potash exports. Africa can not afford fertilizers. May 28, 2028, 2,000 years.

2956,2956,"He is a prophet, Humanity needs a few more like him."
2957,2957,Is this a Ted Talk?
2958,2958,"God, he is so cute! Love seeing him get excited! Im so in love with him! Ugg, Lord, send me such a kind, gentle, sweet, caring, enduring, helpful, man like this️soon please!!"
2959,2959,Water off a ducks back!   You nailed it.    Why isn't this man on a ballot? Go Elon.
2960,2960,"Murder us in our sleep or something, hahaha... "
2961,2961,There are still other energy methods to come that can supply all the clean energy we need.
2962,2962,"Rocket Jesus. There is not enough lithium, let alone for your medication."
2963,2963,I don't get why people are hating this. Elon is going to deliver all of this within the next 2 years... 4 years... 10 years... oh...
2964,2964,"I wish the interviewer gave Elon more time to finish his answers.  I understand he wants to ask as many questions as possible, but he’s cutting him off too soon."
2965,2965,log be trees and maths  
2966,2966,"in 10 years a robot will cost 25K and can only replace a sales guy at the local electronics store by taking a customer to the demo unit and citing the specs… it will still be fit for task and not a general solution to simple diverse tasks. It will be inpossibly in 10 years. A self driving car can only solve one task, making a robot for multiple tasks would help a self driving car not the other way around. That is why Elon is so off on his timeline."
2967,2967,"Matthew 25:31-46

31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left."
2968,2968,Actually we literally need to do nothing to just be a cavemen again to sustain consciousness and climate.
2969,2969,Elon should go on a major platform if he wants to get the message out * cough Rogan *

2972,2972,how great for the planet is mining the cobalt for the batteries ?
2973,2973,How can anyone hate elon they obviously don't do there research and look into all the amazing and positive things he's doin for humanity.
2974,2974,Sounds like the same system for time stamps for satellites is needed for labeling video feeds to make self driving cars safe.

2980,2980,Get this egotistical grifter off of TED. Not the right platform for him.

2983,2983,"Basically robots are book smart, not streetsmart, while I'm both book smart and street smart"

2989,2989,"Got me electric heat, powered by hydro, just need me Tesla & I'm cleeean!  Well still dirty but just in the good ways eh bud?  On the Neuralink stuff it's awesome & I love it just that right now the slowest thing about my phone isn't my thumbs, it's either the internet process, or some kind of localized fuckery in the device, bugs, inefficient software, slow hardware, dead battery etc. For mental illness we already have psychedelic medicines, maybe a chip might do the trick for specific cases but for most it won't be the best answer unless someone wants to be a borg anyway."

Why do the Twitter ideologues hate him so much? What have  they contributed to society? Aside from churlish gibberish and tears?"
2997,2997,Why does all this sustainable energy promotion sound like a lose weight with this new diet in 12 weeks scam
2998,2998,You must predict multiverse states - time and space opinions - to predict behavior. To do that you must define closed and opened systems and all their possible states and flows
2999,2999,"To the question of how he handles all the criticism despite being philanthropic, he answers: “At this point, it’s like water off a duck’s back”. So inspiring, especially coming from a sensitive person like he is.

3002,3002,"A lot of thing being done or not is basically based on profits. Population collapse is encouraged by the economic system. We don't need any hero who births a lot, because such examples don't bring profits. People don't earn that much if they contribute to the population. If this is not solved, the population keeps collapsing. 
I personally don't know why a top businessman would make such mistake. Or, do we humans really have any solution to stop population collapse?"
3003,3003,"When you listen to the drivel of politicians who basically do nothing and talk a lot, this man is our modern day Da Vinci.  He has real vision and he has the drive and ability to make that vision come true - eventually :-)  I do laugh that people criticise him for not predicting things accurately all the time.  Prediction is basically a best guess - irrespective of the calculus used, it's still just a guess.  Id EM perfect?  No, of course not.  He'll get things wrong and that's ok.  We live in a world where it's become toxic to talk about or even acknowledge failure, but one of the big secrets of humanity is that we learn by our mistakes and failures, get up, dust ourselves down and go again.  Elon Musk epitomises this.  He is going to be a big factor in making our reliance on fossil fuels a thing of history.  It may take a hundred years to realise this dream, and he may have to pass on the baton to someone else to fully realise that dream, but that dream will become a reality.  I have more faith in EM's best guesses than the assurances and guarantees of any politician."

3014,3014,"The thing about Musk, besides being a futuristic genius, is that he is out there TRYING hard, and is not very afraid of failure! Many inventors SAY they can handle big failure, but, in reality, they can't. Many fail, and their confidence drops. Musk looks at a failure like we all should; that it's simply another learning tool, and to take advantage of that failure, and move on! To me, THAT is one his biggest personal traits! So many criticize him, while they nothing! Get out of his way, and let him TRY!"

3019,3019,"Making one big Elon company is a bad idea. One example why is solar city. When Tesla purchased solar city those employees were now part of a company with a single focus, produce the Model 3 at scale. This slowed down the solar business. If the Boring company got purchased by Tesla there would be to high of a chance of not being able to focus on tunneling. "

3033,3033,"Low cost sustainability energy, I'm all for it. However as for personal robots.... Basically it will be like a personal PDA or our handphones right now but in a much larger and smarter mobile form that will actually service you and your family members. It will be like the good old Japanese anime - Chobits from 2000 – 2002. The AI in the anime is just amazing. Or maybe even like iRobots the movie. But it is also a double edge sword with AI. If the real-world AI become so powerful and dynamic near to the human level, then why do we even need humans anymore? For a start, jobs will be outsourced to AI robots. How do humans even earn an honest living then? TBH, having a full AI controlled future is not too bright for the next generations. Stephen Hawking already warned us about exploiting too much into AI. Democratization of AI can never achieve as long as there are humans around. Politics and greed from countries and companies will always be there. Do we see Google, Apple, Microsoft or even Huawei exchanging and sharing their AI secrets? I would say, let's not cross the line of AI and resulting us, the humans, suffering from our own actions."
3034,3034,"I realize thie interviewer noted elsewhere that he's no slick TV personality and that some people may not like his interview style, etc., etc. But the reality of the situation is, if he'd just simply stop being so damn self important, it would improve his palatability by an order of magnitude, arguably with everyone. Self important interviewers are not congruent with good journalism."
3035,3035,Elon could fart in jar and dummies will buy it
3036,3036,"How are all the turbines in the ocean & on land, not going to change the climate?? How are the wind turbines & solar panels going to be recycled after they are used up? What do you think about Regrenative Farming?"
3037,3037,10
3038,3038,Oh god not more psycho Elon! Listening to him is poison but to be able to criticise him one must endure such things.
3039,3039,We need to take the likes of Putin into account when considering the future...

3042,3042,เก็บเงินไปดาวอังคาร เริ่ม...
3043,3043,"As much as I admire Elon Musk, I can't help but feel the most profound thing he said in this interview, was 'I'm not always right'. He was referring to his ability to predict the date for the achievement of full self driving cars, and the fact that he has been frequently and vehemently attacked for not being able to foresee the future with precision. By in large, I'm untroubled by this failing, which is more than compensated for by Tesla's amazing insights into the nature of consciousness and intelligence that they have uncovered in their quest to make a machine that can drive a car as well as a human, using only the visual sense and an artificial neural network which mimics the function of a human  brain."
3044,3044,"Only a brief mention of nuclear and suggesting future energy be primarily wind and solar?  Sorry Elon...you lost my interest there.  Now, should you have said this will all take time...decades of course...and that fossil fuels must remain and nuclear revived and used until the green dream might come into fruition...you would have me back."
3045,3045,2033*
3046,3046,Elon is actually NOT CREEPY as many other billionaires who want depopulation to occur
3047,3047,"Attoamost either we ride or drive we are all never thalessss capable but the willingness to stride compares to vigilance I don't want one unless my man is driving, there, do I have one!!!??**""()£€¥"
3048,3048,"One problem with the politics of mars is the politics of 100 people doesn’t work for 1000 people. The politics for 1000 people doesn’t work for 100,000 people. So how does the government grow properly."
3049,3049,I'm glad Elon hasn't forgotten his promise to give us cat girls.
3050,3050,Atom
3051,3051,Every word of this sounded absolutely terrifying.

3055,3055,Great interview. Feel inspired
3056,3056,Wow just wow.. Brilliant visionary…may it happen
3057,3057,"I love this Elon Musk guy. He knows the truth that there is no ""climate emergency"" and admits it but at the same  time he says there is a way out if you buy the things that he is selling. Now that is a winning strategy. So when the disaster  doesn't happen he can say -""See I told  you it would be alright as long as you bought my cars and my batteries and my solar plants and my ..."" Nobody on earth has ever been able to sell a dream like this man and know the formula and live by the mantra of ""a fool and his money is soon parted.""Good on ya Elon - you truly are a genius. The only thing that I don't understand is how you can say all this with a straight face."
3058,3058,Finally a good interviewer for elon.
3059,3059,Love Elon !
3060,3060,"Elon: ""I don't want to blow your mind, but i'm not always right""
Us: Yes u r"
3061,3061,"As good as all the points in this interview are (by both questioner and interviewee), the whole thing begs the question: why are all these problems, and all the others, not actively being solved (or solved already) by 1000 more, 1 million more, 1 billion more, Elon Musk's apiece. And the answer is, simply, capitalism and greed."
3062,3062,Technology depreciates the moment it is put into use.
3063,3063,"24:35
Hope you stick to your promise Elon!"
3064,3064,Elon Musk is the reincarnation of Howard Hughes.
3065,3065,""" We're just monkeys with a computer stuck in our brain.""
- Elon Musk"
3066,3066,He doesn’t believe for 1 second that solar and wind can fuel the planet.
3067,3067,"56:51
He did it.. The billionaire's laugh"
3068,3068,There's equally a large consensus of scientist that do not believe that...for the record.
3069,3069,King Elon musk  .  Long live the king!
3070,3070,"Musk should make the Robot for only consumers first … business later, like iPhone"
3071,3071,"""Elon musk! Great to see you. How are you?""
""I'm good. How are you?""
""I mean.. we're here at the Texas giga factory.""......................"
3072,3072,We are only limited by how much we allow ourselves to limit ourselves!!!
3073,3073,6:17 I'm minting it! What a meme! Elon's best guess
3074,3074,I hope he will take his health seriously
3075,3075,Actually I believe he probably didn't in a good shape that day....depending on his talking and body languages.
3076,3076,"i watched this camped in middle of Nowhere in HD - Starlink

3081,3081,Watched many Elon interviews. They are great.  Interviewer was a distraction this time.  Caused me to stop watching.
3082,3082,Take action and make it so.
3083,3083,"He's not doomsday person? ...... Come on. He says we are in population collapse.....he says a.i. will take over.... He says check the data, then one does and it goes against what he claims on many things including nuclear energy. Thank God the company hires smart sensible people to run the day to day"
3084,3084,How can a guy who purports to think of the future COMPLETLY  ignore the holy grail of limitless energy....FUSION power???  All of human kinds energy needs to be focused on solving that problem.  We have the rest of time to build electric cars.
3085,3085,Amazing

3095,3095,Brilliant
3096,3096,"How can he create & send sophisticated rockets to Mars but cant get a car to self drive on Earth?  Like NASA,  said they cant duplicate the calcs they used to get to the Moon in 1969 so we will never go back there. Does that make any sense?"
3097,3097,100:42 Where is the “we” that was so prevalent at the Giga Rodeo? :)
3098,3098,"I think Elon Musk's best and worst ability is, that he dont lie.."

3112,3112,"The end is near!  This has been a mantra that has permeated society for as long I can remember.  The scenario involves the world being destroyed by a virus, nuclear bombs, asteroids, volcanos, earthquakes, pollution, artificial intelligence going haywire and the oldest, fire and brimstone.  Now the threat is being drowned by the oceans, similar to Kevin Costner's movie, Waterworld.  There's to many moronic movies like this!"

Darn, I wonder if anyone has thought what they would have liked their present to be, forget the future!"" I have definitely thought about it and I know the future outlined here does not even come close to the best we can do!

Say, India 1.8 billion, China with about 2 billions, Indonesia 267 million, etc... A small electric car many less facilities of the one produce right now can help a lot to drop the pollution that is rampant.

He sees everyone as human being & never passes judgment on whatever they are guilty of. I'm a tad disappointed that she used the fact she was in a domestic violence situation on all of her infractions & tried to get out of paying. Not to say she wasn't in a bad situation but just like he said, not all were a direct reflection of being pursued."

623,623,"It looks like more like a dreamy world and I still cant believe, he is a real judge..People sending cheques to help others?? Woah...Can I imagine this in India?"
624,624,God bless you more wherever you are blessings

631,631,"Who has seen ""The hugging part"" thrice....1st with tears in the eyes, ....2nd to watch it clearly .... & 3rd for satisfaction"
632,632,Dios lo bendiga por siempre el no es juez; el es un ángel juez deberíamos tenerlo como presidente de los Estados Unidos 🇺🇸 Porque si tenerlo como juez es un honor imagínense tenerlo de presidente sería un orgullo y una bendición.
633,633,"Two things I have learned. One, tear is one of a women's most powerful weapons. Two, I have never met a kind hearted recruiter or HR"

637,637,"How I wished from my heart that this judge would be the president of our country, Iraq, even for one year, and if that was not, I hope that Iraq will be governed by someone who has even a few of the characteristics of this judge."
638,638,"If only there are ten person like him in every government of every country on this planet  we call Earth ,Then I guess We can all have smile on our faces,not this hatred and suspicion we keep inside.."
639,639,"As a former (obviously not very successful) bank robber,  not to excuse my behavior,  but I had pled guilty and agreed to a 40  month sentence with the DA  The judge said "" if don't think I like that"" and gave me instead 13 years. With the judge smiling as he did so ( appeal courts chopped it to 10 years) having put my criminal career long behind  ( . I would have loved during my crisis going on to have  had such a compassionate juste as this amazing man.,He teaches us that not all are there to railroad you. Stay safe all! Cheers!"
640,640,"That was really nice of the Judge as usual. However, using all the 3 cheques on a single individual is by far very unfair. Those cheques are meant for different people in distress.
She is working. Help her with the largest cheque & put her on a payment plan as the Judge does with others. Thumbs up for the kind judge nonetheless."
641,641,"Mr Chief Judge, you will go to heaven. Love from Pakistan"
642,642,I watch it  in tears....hopefuly these such a good example can be done in Indonesia.

663,663,Jedan od predivnih sudija pravedan za razliku od vecine  svaka mu cast mnogima je pomogao
664,664,Judges like Frank Caprio a few and far between.  He has a heart of gold for matters of the heart when it comes to PEOPLE!  They aren't just CASES.  He could definitely teach judge Judy more then a thing or two.  She is very rude to the people she judges and even yells at them and calls them names ON THE AIR!!!!
665,665,He the best freak'n judge ever.
666,666,"wait. Someone's name Joseph BADASS? So technically, he's a Badass."
667,667,Humanity still exits 
668,668,Judge maybe reassured her faith that not all men are abusive and dangerous 
669,669,A great person. Judges should be like him. Here in my country if i go to court i am not allowed to talk to judge directly. They just listen to the advocate only. Hes so good at judging and thats the only way to treat people. If a judge start treating them as a criminal people would have mental effects on their minds.
670,670,"Dudes I didn't know there are people who feel the Word of God. Judges are established by God Himself, and if we have a sober minded judges than we are OK!"

696,696,"I would like to deal with people in a regular basis with the same attitude as the judge but the reality is way different,this particular events look like a science fiction action./He acts like a good human being."
697,697,"He is my favorite Judge but I had questions what if many are just actors trying to fool him by telling lies.
I am asking this is because many comes up with emotional stories, what if they are just fooling him"

702,702,the he rules that court room is with compassion and love .  his rulings change these people lives and makes them want better for themselves .  .  he judges the situations and circumstances and not people themselves . may god treat fair judges in the best of manners amen.

728,728,"America will never have a judge better than Judge Caprio, he's a true New Englander and a pure blooded American. He makes me feel patriotic about this country even when I question how much I respect this nation's leadership. I love my country and it's people, but not the ones in charge of our lives. Caprio is changing that every single time a person enters his court room to be heard."
729,729,"That,s how a judge should judge."
730,730,I hope this judge would be as lenient to an abused father as he is another 'female victim'

733,733,if a guy goes there and say I am paying child support for four kids and I was under a lot of stress ... does he do the same? or it is the emotional decision based on natural feeling to protect woman ??

808,808,When I think of this Judge I cannot help but think of Moses as well who was a Judge of his people who had wisdom and a compassionate heart as well.

I've watched this show so many times and I have to say that he is the best example of what a compassionate human being should be, never mind being a compassionate and empathetic judge. He tries to find the best in people, and will pry it out of them when he knows its there. He always refers to his family and has fondest feelings for our veterans.

It leaves a doubt in mind the litigants that the lawyer do whatever possible to get another date. This is bad for the justice process in the country. Hope BAS will not complaint me for disrespect to courts!

1109,1109,"he shouldn't be a judge, he should teach the judges"
1110,1110,"People say there need to be more people like him, but I would say the majority of people in this world have a similar sense of empathy and compassion as he does. Look at all the people who send in money, from all over the world, to help other people who need a break. In my experience, this is the majority. Don’t look at the few instances of hatred that get the most broadcast, sway your feelings of the generosity in the world. Hatred is the minority, although the media want you to think the opposite."
1111,1111,AWSOME 
1112,1112,"4:10 woman in the background left down corner, thats awesome"

1127,1127,What a great guy man

If everyone would go out and do one nice thing for someone they don't know just think how much better our world would be."

Instead up having a stick up his @ss and doing everything by the book he knows that sometimes there are reasons for minor infractions - not violent ones, but ones like this or someone has a few joints on them or something. Context is everything and throwing the book at someone no matter what is just blind judging."

I said not guilty your honor, he said, get out of my court. I was lost to whether I was supped to pay the ticket or if it is being dismissed. As the judge called for the next case, I stood up there at loss, and asked him am I supposed to pay the ticket or is it dismissed? He yelled at me again, do you want to pay the ticket? I said no, he said get out of my court and he was still holding on to my ticket. I am glad his assistance looked at me and she said don’t worry it is dismissed. I have no clue why that judge was in a bad mood that day."

My favourite video with him is when he helped that Vet out. He doesn’t need to be so kind, yet he does good nonetheless. He inspires me to be more empathetic and impartial to judgement as well. So thank you good Sir, if the off chance you see this comment — Thank you! I know it goes without saying but your actions do make a difference and are impactful."

2190,2190,People with good ️ respect
2191,2191,It's great to see this.  The judge was so kind.  I am in a country where the honorable judge doesn't even talk to the defendant.  Wish some one help me as I am without job for more than five years and cannot leave the country of domicile to support my young kids.
2192,2192,Why do I always end up here.. love this guy

2201,2201,give the old man a hug and cover all your costs!
2202,2202,Awww that’s sweet
2203,2203,"If I was a judge, I would rule out that an investigation of whoever was harassing her and her daughter be taken into action, to ensure their safety, if the pursuer hadn’t been caught yet that is."

2223,2223,"Not even one judge in Germany would handle this matter like him.
Nice greetings from Germany "
2224,2224,"Appreciate the sentiment but believe it is misplaced in this case.  This person looks to be a habitual danger to others on the road and whatever her problems may be, she shouldn't be driving."

2350,2350,You are such a great person judge caprio wish there were more people like you
2351,2351,Our nation would be in alot better shape if we had more judges like this man.
2352,2352,It is so sad that so many US Americans find this so unusual.  There are different ways for police and courts to operate. They are happening all over the world and mostly not in the US. One example   for non violent inmates in some European countries they have open door prisons. You must stay on the grounds but you can come and go  to the main prison as you like. Just be there at 10pm nightly.  These are juveniles getting training for when they get out. They work well in Ireland.  Secondly I see how the  police interact with US Americans on the street and people stand for it.  If a police person in Ireland ever interacted with a person like that in Ireland there would be a revolution.  So when they executed George Floyd on the streets of  Minneapolis  I wish I was shocked. I was not  at all. A different way is possible.
2353,2353,Omg ! That judge has the heart in right place!
2354,2354,القلوب الرحيمة
2355,2355,Love you judge caprio . You make this world a better place

2375,2375,So scary that someone was chasing her. How can someone do that. Great people who donated to help her. Bless the decent in the world.
2376,2376,"Y'all fixin' to make me cry!  Darn y'all and your kind ways!! God bless Judge Caprio and Inspector Quinn, and the other inspector, who's name I don't know. ️️️"

2381,2381,"Omg I cant believe he exists, come on, I remember going into court for Jury service,  I was shaking with fear,  the judge was a mean piece of crap, he convicted the guy before we even gave him our answer, we said not guilty and he said wow didn't see that coming  and that's the truth, never been back in court. I'm flying to Providence just to look at him, maybe get a hug. He is so adorable. Lo e his soul  his spirit, his everything."

He was soft spoken, listened to people, very understanding, and would regularly lower fines. He wasn't a push over, but was compassionate, and would try to help everybody. Judge Caprio reminds me of him."

2389,2389,Top
2390,2390,"If you didn't already notice .... 
He asked ""Can you afford 125?"" after giving her a hug . 
That's his character. Not the one he shows on microphone or on seat of judge....but when he's off the seat , off the mic and REALLY taking care of people."
2391,2391,OMG this judge always make me cry he's generous and kind GOD bless you
2392,2392,Wtf ?? Is this even a original court ? More like some court drama series
2393,2393,He is an awesome individual and a very compassionate judge. But I think some people take advantage of his compassion. I believe that to be the case with the first woman.
2394,2394,Your wife will punish you
2395,2395,helping others is the key to living a good life

2523,2523,"If this was in the UK, they might have literally destroyed her & took her to prison and take out her humanity there and turn her into a crazy monster, so that when she would get out, she re-offend again. They would wish for her to be in this circle for all of her life, while conducting  implicit torture, with the aim of slowly making her a crazy monster who lives in a never ending hell. For the British this kind of acting is seen as one of the most righteous things, destroying someone makes them feel very intelligent. Thus ideology stems from a long and a very evil British mindset which originates from the Middle Ages, but also from their belief that if somebody makes a mistake; I.e steel, then that is because they are genetically wired fo r that. Meaning they will never surpass that nature."
2524,2524,What a man
2525,2525,"I’d love to say there should be more judges like this, but there’s probably a thin line between good judges like this & radical leftist bleeding heart ones to the point they’d extend the same compassion & kindness to someone who has murdered, raped, abused & committed other assorted heinous crimes to others & undermines social & legal order. Clearly this judge is rationale, kind & empathetic but someone who still enforces the rules, tough enough to still lay down the law when he has to. But, yes, there needs to be more fair-minded, reasonable judges like this."

Love and respect from Pakistan."
2531,2531,How cool is Quinn ....I love this show
2532,2532,"Compare this to the actions of DSC 37 112 Matthew Lindsay in Victoria Australia.  Lindsay incarcerated me for two summary charges, (i) failure to give my address at the time of arrest and (ii) unlicensed driving.  I have never been convicted or charged with either of these offences previously.  I pleaded not guilty so the Magistrate incarcerated me on remand even though I had an address, a job, a partner and a daughter.  I went to the Supreme Court of Victoria for bail and the Supreme Court Judge Justice Coghlin continued to remand me in custody - the highest court in the state - for refusing to give my residential address when arrested.  Justice Coghlin stated, and I quote directly, ""You will not get bail from me until you give me that address.""  I have the court transcripts.  I was remanded in custody for 22 months for 'failing to give my residential address when arrested'.  I was then bailed - after 22 months - on $50,000.00.  It is now nearly five years since  the charges.  I refuse to plead guilty and Lindsay DSC 37112 is still trying to convict me of 'failure to give my residential address when arrested'."

2558,2558,"There was an opinion that all good people in the world died before 1950. I think it is wrong. There are STILL some (many?) good people on earth.

I have seen some of the verdicts of this judge. He never fails to amaze me.  Particularly his LOVE for children and his involving children in the hearing. "

2567,2567,Kindness.
2568,2568,"I hope this judge plays hardball with some people every once in a while.  Every time I see him he ALWAYS believes the sop story presented by the person charged. Crocodile tears! Don't get me wrong - there are those who have good reason to break a law sometimes, but, when someone habitually drives through amber or red lights (not in this case), they deserve a huge wakeup message from the judge."

2588,2588,"First of all. Anyone who is a stalker or domestic abuser and you're reading this, your days in freedom are numbered and you will be caught and most likely convicted. When you arrive in jail you better pray you are not in general population or you'll get raped and stalked too. To this lady, I hope things get better for you. Thanks Judge Caprio for using these cheques to pay for this lady's fines and last but not least, thanks to the donors for your generosity. You're all amazing "
2589,2589,I am here for the first time and I'm lost now. Is it real or it's a tv show? Thanks!
2590,2590,"Omg, how cool the judge is....i mean he is doing a ecstatic job!"
2591,2591,"Why didn't she tell the cops that pulled her over that she was being chased? He would have at minimum made a note, and there was nothing from the cops about it. Suspicious to me."

قلب كبير وابيض
انسان محترم ومثقف

2596,2596,"The Lord Jesus Christ's work right here... Compassion, understanding, empathy and CHARITY.  The bible states if someone in need opens their hands out and asks for help, you should give it.  Even if they don't ask and you know they are in need you should still help.  IE if a homeless person goes to a church and asks for money to help them then that priest that church should willingly give.  Ask why 99% refuse?  Are they doing Gods work or the satan's?  Then ask why the roman catholic church is worth over a trillion dollars and further ask who they truly represent?  God or satan..."

2603,2603,"This is the same thing that God did for us through Jesus Christ :) All of humanity are guilty of breaking God's law of rightousness, daily. But God sent Jesus to take our punishment (pay our fine) so all who believe in Him will not perish , but have everlasting life in heaven. Isn't that dope!! I think so"

2610,2610,"The gospel by which we're SAVED. We're under Paul's ministry today. Therefore we're not under the law of the old testament. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)(1) Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the GOSPEL (good news) which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; (2) By which also ye are SAVED, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain (self). (3) For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that CHRIST DIED for our SINS according to the scriptures; (4) And that he was BURIED, and that he ROSE AGAIN the THIRD DAY according to the scriptures."
2611,2611,I think this judge makes order and law like a joke. Every sad story goes through without checking the truth out very easily.
2612,2612,
2613,2613,The compassion of Lord Jesus Christ still prevails in the  U.S. Bible says 'Righteousness exalteth a nation '

2616,2616,"Very inappropriate for a judge to accept a hug from a young vulnerable person like that. The judge is there to apply the law, not take personal gratification for his actions. First Lady is beautiful."
2617,2617,That’s ridicules.Tomorrow we will see a judge marriage proposal.This is a judge not a place for non sense emotions.The camera is always on him and surely he knows what the audience expect from him
2618,2618,The heart of men there is riches/poor. Whom do you serve?

During court you are asked guilty or not guilty  then if u say guilty u are  screwed then your insurance go up and u will have points on your record. What a corrupt system and so unscrupulous.We must not treat people unfairly for anything and everything this prototype system must be edited, changed and improved to serve our people with integrity, fairness and honesty. The court system shouldn't work as a corporate trying to generate money from struggling citizens so shameless."

2670,2670,"I'm sorry but this ""innocent looking"" lady is guilty. Can't back the judge on this one. If more judges were like him there would definitely be a rise on crime. She works as a recruiter and earns a lot on commission. Those funds raised by those immigrants should have been sent to actual people in need."

0,0,So this cop immediately thought a 7 yr old littering was more criminal than an adult choking a 7 yr old.  Unbelievable
1,1,"""This man assaulted my 7 year old son.""
""Well, maybe you're not raising your child right.""

The cop mind, ladies and gentlemen."
2,2,"Always record anytime you’re dealing with the police, even if you are the one to call them."
3,3,so it appears the cop really didn't give a damn if the guy put his hands on the child or not
4,4,"You can tell by his disposition that he was never on her side from the jump, he was there to aid the white neighbor"
5,5,She called for HELP. Not to be HARASSED. It's not that hard!  Absolutely Shameful.
6,6,This is sad .They call the police for help and instead they get assaulted by the police. crazy
7,7,"Man:  ""That kid littered, so I chocked him out"". 
Cop:  ""Good for you sir!  That'll teach him a lesson"".  Indeed it will Mr. Policeman."
8,8,"With cops like this guy, who needs cops? The guy obviously is on a power trip and gets triggered at the first hint of a black person suggesting how he could do his job better."
9,9,"Let’s  take race out of this for a minute.
A grown man put his hands on the neck of a child. The complete stranger chocked a child he didn’t know. I don’t care if they are black, white, yellow or polka dot this is WRONG and a CRIME.  End of discussion. If we as a human race can’t agree the no matter race, color or creed no child should be choked. Then we have lost our compassion and humanity."
10,10,"I don't care if the screaming annoys you, or what you think about black people, or littering.  The issue was the man choking her seven year old child.  The officer literally ignored that accusation, did nothing to address it, and proceeded to criticize her about her parenting.  He then proceeded to actually defend the man choking her child.  It is right there in the video.  So he ignored accusations of a physical assault (of which she called the police about), and continued to lecture her on something that was not the issue at hand at all.  He was in the wrong.  It is not illegal to argue with an officer, and all her daughter did was step in between them to calm her mother down (was not facing the officer, was not threating in the least).  There was no reason to arrest either of them.  This is a perfect illustration of the racial bias that the liberals you find so annoying talk about.  What else could it have been?  You tell me."
11,11,They literly didn't do anything. That cop clearly didn't need to do any of that.
12,12,the officer was clearly acting out of emotion and was extremely unprofessional.
13,13,"“ He was fearing for his life, that’s why he had to tackle her.”"
14,14,Good thing they were able to get it on film to prove that this actually happened
15,15,Resisting arrest? Why was she being arrested for in the first place
16,16,"Wow, way to escalate the situation.
The cop was the one to use violence first, and that should never be the case unless it's immanent.
It's horrible to have to say this, but at the very least, no one ended up getting shot here.
And of course, the guy who choked the minor was never charged with a crime in the first place. I'm sure he's doing fine."
17,17,"Black person: Breathes

30 cop cars pulling up: GET DOWN ON THE GROUND AIR IS ILLEGAL IF YOU'RE BLACK"
18,18,"We are never protected. As usual. Unfortunately it affects the ones who are violent in no way, shape or form."
19,19,"If it bothered the guy so much, why not simply pick up the piece of paper? Good grief. There’s other ways to go about this.
As for the officer, I’m beginning to wonder if they issued any kind of IQ test upon his application into the department cause that idiot is quite literally “the bottom of the barrel.”"
20,20,"Girl steps in to calm her mother down facing her literally away from the cop""
cop ""thats assault thats assault"""
21,21,"How to give a cop a hard time

Cop: ""Get down on the ground""
You: I'm already on the ground. Does it look like I'm in an airplane?"
22,22,We need to make a federal law that you cannot be charged for resisting arrest unless it's accompanied by a lawful arrest. I.e. you assaulted someone police tell u you're under arrest then resist. Not just resisting. It's like taking the effect and making it the cause! I call BS for anyone who's only charged with resisting.
23,23,You could tell by the cop 'posing' he was against the woman to begin with.
24,24,"We know this is a problem. My advice to anyone in her position. When it comes to dealing with the police. Keep it short and sweet. 
The victims mother ""This man grabbed my child!""
 Officer ""Why did he grabbed your child?"" The mother "" Ask him!""  "
25,25,What happens to  the guy who assaulted the son ?
26,26,Lesson: never ever EVER call the cops even if you are the victim — especially if you are a person of color
27,27,I'm devastated at the lack of morality in these so called police officers.
28,28,This happens so much around the world where I feel like it just ends up on the news or posted on YouTube for entertainment and comments and no further action
29,29,"That young girl tried to bring peace to the weird situation and for that she ended being arrested, even more weird."
30,30,"When I saw the original video I was angry with the officer that he had no empathy that this seven year old child was choked. His ""So what"" attitude was disgusting. He kept telling her not to yell but I can assure you my voice would have been raised as well. He's questioning her parenting as well. No one should be choking a child. I personally feel the officer escalated this situation....."
31,31,Resisting arrest is code for “humbler” aka you hurt my feelings so I’ll inconvenience you the best that I can....
32,32,"Thing is, any real man who watches this video knows he is a COWARD"
33,33,"Apparently a lecture saying ""Teach your son not to litter"" is more important than strangling a young child"
34,34,Every decent cop in the nation who is filled with anxiety nowadays should be calling for the firing AND arrest of this cop.
35,35,The fact that the daughter tried to help her mom
36,36,"""We will investigate ourselves quickly, fairly, and exonerate our brother officer as quickly as humanly possible. You can trust us."""
37,37,They edited the clip....he said some other foul things too
38,38,Me and all my siblings would’ve put that cop in hand cuffs and dipped with the keys
39,39,"What is there to investigate the guy is CLEARLY wrong and doesn't know how to do his job as does many others, it's sad that in these instances civilians have to tell the people that were suppose to be ""protecting us"" how to do their job"
40,40,"Her : ""I need help""
Cops : ""Your'e Under Arrest""
Her : ""Why""
Cops: ""Your'e Black"""
41,41,"It's 2022 and after 6 years of litigation, the cop has been cleared of all charges..."
42,42,"If I were the cop I would've arrested the man. Seriously, nothing pisses me off more than adults putting their hands on kids who aren't theirs."
43,43,he was fearless and he knew he was being recorded and said what he said anyway it’s so scary it’s one  of the reasons why I don’t want to live in Texas
44,44,It doesn't matter  you are innocent or not. They'll charge you of anything you do against you.
45,45,I’ve had two cars go missing they were both parked beat up vehicles I wasn’t driving anymore. Didn’t call the police. The value of those cars aren’t worth putting myself at risk. I can say I’ve lived my entire life without calling them.
46,46,Why dont they fire the cops
47,47,"You can clearly see this cop was out to provoke and escalate. When the woman's daughter tried to intervene to calm the situation down the cop knew that if he didn't start pushing and pulling on them his moment to escalate this to a point where he can allow himself to abuse them would've been gone, if not then he should have welcomed the daughter calming the mother down."
48,48,How can you JUST charge someone with Resisting Arrest? Don’t you have to be arrested for a actual crime to resist an arrest? I feel like resisting arrest with no other crime committed is just a way for officers to abuse their power.
49,49,"Life Lesson:   If you are in an emergency in the US,  call the town mayor, or the neighbors for help"
50,50,"Greate officer, I'll recommend to upgrade him as a cop <3 Peace and love from GAZA :D"
51,51,THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CALL THE COPS!!!!!
52,52,"Why do people do this what's so different about us

Only color"
53,53,I've yet to see ONE of these where  the people respect the cop and comply or are reasonable. It seems the guy accused of hitting her kid didn't get beat up..and the person causing the disturbance was the mother.
54,54,This among one of the most beautiful things I've seen.
55,55,He got a 10 day suspension and was passed on a promotion.
56,56,"That's not all of it... The officer even asked the woman ""WHY is the stranger not allowed to hit her son for littering""?"
57,57,In other words we need time to find something or make up a reason to bail us out
58,58,1:01 He charged the girl recording too!!!?! Wtf
59,59,GTA 5's police AI was accurate when the cop shot Franklin for visiting the police station.
60,60,This officer needs to be arrested
61,61,I   percent Agree with the woman In This .she deserved justice for the police officer not doing helping or doing anything on arresting or talking to the guy who tried choking her kid and then proceeds to tackle the mom of the kid who clearly did nothing but jsut arguing with the officer for calling her a. Bad parent and not listening or caring to what she said about her son. 
62,62,we ask that we are given time to examine the evidence and create a cover story to protect our officer ....is more like the truth
63,63,"I thought cops were here to ""protect and serve"".  What was I thinking!!"
64,64,"I saw this before and now see another angle in this scenario, when the daughter intervened it was facing her mother before there was a physical confrontation which is an act of de- escalation but the cop didn't care, grabs her things escalated then we had this situation."
65,65,I know this is very harsh but they’re some people who just need to be cut out of humanity
66,66,OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT NO MATTER WHAT RACE THEY ALL DESEVER THE SAME RESPECT.
67,67,It’s nice the officer get a paid vacation while they investigate themselves. They need to have a civilian board investigate them
68,68,"“They were charged for resisting arrest” but here’s the thing, they resist the arrest because of what happened in the start, it’s just that u ignore that factor and say they were resisting arrest so it can be legal, but that always eases the question of WHY were they resisting arrest, which most would’ve known, YOU TRIED TO ARREST FOR A BULLCRAP REASON"
69,69,"“It’s unclear if it’s been edited”

Bro they are literally recording a screen with another device, if that’s the only way they know how to “give a copy how the video” how do expect them to know how to edit it?"
70,70,"The law must give the citizens to defence theirself against the criminal cops. In this situation this bad cop would be tased and 000 would be called for good cops and he would be put in jail. If he would have used his gun, he would be shut deadly."
71,71,Truly unbelievable behaviour by that cop
72,72,"absoluely racist, had those been white folk he wouldn't have felt 'pissed' at their anger openly"
73,73,Now you see why people don't call the police in some situations.
74,74,These people investigate themselves and their partners and find themselves and their partners innocent of all charges
75,75,"""investigating"" yea that's just an excuse to just forget about it"
76,76,"Well that’s typical of bad cops like him. He grabbed the child because she seem to be an easier target and or, he wanted to be free to feel on her before he abuses the both of them. There was no reason for him to touch or, include that young woman in his P.O’ed attack on these two ladies."
77,77,Would love to know what was the outcome of this.  I bet nothing happened to the cop.
78,78,"Them: ""There are still good cops around"".....""where""?"
79,79,I really feel bad for this woman. I am truly sorry that this happened. She trusted Law Enforcement. And they failed her. I hope she can move past this
80,80,What was the outcome of this situation???
81,81,"Man, I remember those days when the USOf A were the promised land...Well, dont mind if I dont"
82,82,"The office forgot why he went there for, he failed to de-escalate de situation, I have seen hundreds of videos where over 90% the police officers are escalating the situation when the first contact is with black family, I don't understand why the fear, why the escalation of circumstances keeps been done. This action need to stop across the country. Training of all police officers should a priority of all city Governor, city Mayor or any officials, because you may don't see nothing wrong with this procedures don't to our citizens until you experience it first hand."
83,83,Imagine if there was a whole family they would have smacked him up
84,84,Tyler Perry please run for president we need you now
85,85,just shows this officer thinks its ok to choke a 7 yr old but you can't speak loudly to him.  incredible
86,86,Poor cop
87,87,"I know this probably won't matter,but even though this lady was arrested for no reason,yet that cop was STILL able to pull his taser out on her,yet we got other cops (not saying all) who arrest people and STILL pull they gun out. Like WHAT THE HECK?!"
88,88,"But for me, I swear out warrants, high noon the next day he would fugitive. The police cared, but the Mom was so aggressive and shouting and disrespecting toward him. He pretty much summed it up what are you teaching your child, (I can't see her teaching her child manners and respect if she coming off toward him like this). The daughter jumped to stop Mom things got out of hand. Things like this make me feel sorry for them. But that guy with his demon self - if the man had been in the house he wouldn't her boy."
89,89,I am glad to be seeing intelligent people expressing their rage in the comments.
90,90,"Ok, the full video is available, Tazer never used, the kid ran between a officer and the person complaining, in the video she says to stop her mum attacking, so she felt her mum was getting irate, however, the officer asked why the kid threw litter and the mum said it didn't matter and wouldn't listen, the officer said he is just asking questions to find out what happened. Mum needs to control her kids, she has enough to practice on."
91,91,"These kind of situations make me question, us humans would surviving long on earth."
92,92,what r they investigating lol it’s all in the video
93,93,"Pro-police supporter here.

That officer came in WAY to hot. He didnt want to acknowledge that someone else put their hands on not their kid. I agree if your son did litter, teach him to not litter. But you can't just assume he littered without any actual proof. So the officer is at fault for most of it. However the mother shouldnt have gotten up in his face. HOWEVER, the officer did not have to take her to the ground along with her 15 year old daughter, he could've simply issued a verbal warning."
94,94,Question? Is this our fault? Would this happen if we hired a defence league to deal with these physical aggressors aggressively?
95,95,"Why do I feel  FEAR  when a Police Officer approaches me, when I should feel  SAFE  in the presence of a Police Officer?"
96,96,"I believe littering is wrong, but putting his hand on the child was not necessary at all.  The officer needs to be fired for what he did to that poor women."
97,97,"Alright I'm not calling police ever again unless I really have no choice I thank people on YouTube 

For advising me not to call police or paramedics anymore."
98,98,"C:  Criminal

O:  Officers"
99,99,"This is another example why anyone should never trust any ""law enforcement """
100,100, so funny
101,101,Maybe the cop is just really passionate about a clean environment. Littering is no bueno
102,102,"Cách hát của Phúc hiện đại, tinh tế và mang hơi hướng Kpop nhưng lại rất ấm áp, dịu dàng...1 ca khúc tuyệt vời "
103,103,It’s sad that she called for help and ended up getting arrested
104,104,It’s gonna get to the point where honest people/politicians/police officer... continue to allow their “racist criminal peers” to commit crimes and treat people like this... putting those people in danger every single time nothing is done ... people will be forced to defend themselves against racist like this in certain position ...
105,105,Wow......cop definitely over reacted...... but listening to this mother talking....before I played this video..I had my suspicions....
106,106,Thats how America is now days
107,107,"That's how the police treated us during the civil rights era . 

The way racist view black people is wrong . He had no compassion for a mother and her child , that she was trying to protect.  I blame the supreme court/attorney general because they have the power to rule over the injustices in this country. There should be millions of lawsuits to compensate for these injustices but the system is stacked up against us."
108,108,Love this! Great cop!
109,109,She called the cops for help and instead gets arrested . Wow . We need serious police reform .
110,110,"These people think they don't have to treat police as humans, honestly what did you expect to happen when you freak out like that. Good on the police for handling it."
111,111,"Why were you arrested? 
For resisting arrest ️"
112,112,lol don't call the cops
113,113,Still feel good for anonymous playing fck the police in other police radios
114,114,Love this cop keep up the good work
115,115,IS IT ILLEGAL TO CALL FOR HELP?! BRUH THESE COPS BEING RIDICULOUS NOW.
116,116,This is American human rights and democracy
117,117,Ain't nobody got time for that.
118,118,probably a rough night with his boyfriend.
119,119,Get the sociopaths off the force or lose all respect in the community.
120,120,“Unclear if it was edited” see how he threw det in dere
121,121,"People need to understand that police officers are people behind badges, they have emotions just like everyone else. I use to work in a call center and people believe because you are an employee they can talk to you anyway they like and call you anything they like and you have to take it. No one in America has respect anymore, no one thinks what it's like to be the other guy."
122,122,I hope the officer is ok must have been a stressful day for him and know that officers go through a lot of bs and stress o hope he is back on duty
123,123,1:12 What an elegant man.
124,124,"Sometimes just being human is not enough, so much love for blacks"
125,125,I am so glad that the police officers that were resisted from his job he doesn’t deserve to have a good life and a great job because he is so racist by arresting to black woman or resting the whole family just because they’re black and he arrested the mother dad who called for help he’s such a bad police officer.
126,126,Hahahah justified
127,127,That cop is a hero!!! Give him a medal!!!
128,128,"Cop supporters should really sympathize with some but not all of the cop haters who actually have legit reasons to hate them and this is one of them. Similar thing happened to one of my family members when he called the cops on his wife attacking him only to have him arrested instead. Even though he was acquitted for that. Cops today are protecting criminals from victims and it’s not the question of race. It’s about favoritism. Forget the cop haters who are law breakers or wannabe law breakers. Focus on the innocent ones. If you still don’t understand, then I hope you become victimized by the police when your a victim of a crime and get thrown in jail. Then you’ll know how some of us feel."
129,129,You called for it smart guy
130,130,"If an adult stranger assaults your minor child, would you not be upset? Seriously compassion must be a learned behavior that some parents have failed to teach. Why is he not talking to the MAN who assaulted the child? Why is he justifying the poor behavior? I’m disgusted."
131,131,This is sad rip
132,132,Famliy needs to be send to boot camp
133,133,"If you are in trouble or are killed, you can blame the police, it’s their fault."
134,134,"It's the way she was talking to the officer.
RESPECT , RESPECT , RESPECT LEARN THAT !"
135,135,That was your first mistake: having American police deal with the situation
136,136,"Believe me Black women are almost innocent every time.....They are just too kind to commit a guilt....Whenever I have encountered black women , they have been nicer,  everytime.....I respect them a lot..... I still remember the days when I was on my own and was left alone with no money, it was the kind black lady who gave me a job without actually letting me do any work, provided me with food and helped my way to clear my exams back in 2016.... And today,  here I am in 2nd year of MBBS towards my way to become a doctor (INSHALLAH)........These are the Kind people who run the world not the ones who look cool or handsome....When there will be no kindness left in this world, it would be the end of the world ....."
137,137,They started jumping on him and was resisiting arrest the officers did there job and did nothing wrong
138,138,Great arrest those thieves
139,139,"She wouldn’t need to call the cops, if she had a husband at the home who was also the father of that son. Ahh the good old days."
140,140,"It’s a scam for money. 
Call the cops, then attack the cops responding, then cry victim, then collect the $$$$$$$."
141,141,Raise your children right and teach them to respect law enforcement. It's a no-brainer
142,142,"Aside from the issue of the man ""putting his hands on"" the little boy. Here's a tip. If you're going to call tge coos to report someone's inappropriate behavior, it helps if you act appropriately. So yelling and cursing and carrying on with the histrionics doesn't help. I get that emotions are involved. But come off as cool, collected and in control, and you will have better results every time. If the guy really did grab the little boy, he was out of line and should be dealt with accordingly."
143,143,This black man kills me always on the scene
144,144,Now you got an innocent woman afraid to ever call the police for help again.  Big round of applause for the most successful street gang in US history.
145,145,I would of ran up and made sure he had no more kids I’d you know what I mean  and I would of took that shot
146,146,Damn fine police work.
147,147,It behooves folks to not be confrontational with authority help you summon. Lest you become a self inflicted victim.
148,148,The tape was OBVIOUSLY edited. The cop did a fantastic job. It is SOO pathetic that so many racists would ralley behind the black woman just because she is black.
149,149,good job，sir
150,150,as a lawyer never play the race card  and never argue with a police or walk up to or near him file a complaint
151,151,"Wow I'm tell ya I love America it's my spiritual home but dang these American cops make me thankful I'm in England and cops here are largely good helpful guys an girls who are not racist, now u may have a few but I never came across them. Dam I never ever thought I'd say it but I'm proud of British cops on the whole."
152,152,1) the man should have been charged with assault 2) the woman should have recieved a ticket for littering
153,153,"I honestly think only 5%  of black people in the hood have a high school diploma. How is it so hard to have a civil conversation? I find it hard to believe that the kid had a hand around his neck. I mean, you're in the ghetto for a reason but that is no reason parents shouldn't teach their kids how to socialize. At least make an attempt to get out of bed in the morning and get you're kids to school more than once or twice a week."
154,154,yelling at the dude and wondering why he got aggressive. bruh moment 
155,155,Dam! How tall is that cop?
156,156,I NEVER speak to the law that way. I call setup. He was just asking questions. He never said the boy deserved to be choked. He probably didn't believe the loud mouthed woman. And when they got too close he had to protect himself.
157,157,how could the cops say that teen girl was resisting when he grabbed her for nothing
158,158,She had a bad attitude from the beginning....how unusual lol
159,159,I hate how cops can arrest people for “resisting arrest.” what was the charge to get them arrested?
160,160,"I guess I am different . If I was speaking to a police officer I would not be screaming and he looked alone I seen the whole crowd circling him. To me they were causing a disturbance, Getting in the way of an investigation, And hey BLM right so does our planet I think the cop could have taught your child a lesson on littering, but you were just screaming. and out of control. things you might want to teach your child. Just a thought.. But nope you will call the race card you will sue the department so your free ride can continue...."
161,161,If the cop felt he was threatened then he has the right to take action. No one was hurt so i dont see what the big deal is.
162,162,"He arrested her for raising her voice and acting a fool. I would have a problem if a stranger put his hands on my kid too. Clear the woman of wrong doing, apologise for the stupid arrest and tell the man to talk to the parent if he has a problem with someone’s kid. But stop honoring stupid lawsuits with huge amounts of money for stupid arrests with no damages"
163,163,Just another day for the police .  The officer was found to have done nothing wrong and the family was given some taxpayers money to go away
164,164,"The black woman escalated the situation herself. What was the cop supposed to do, let blacks surround him and let them hype themselves up? Well done, officer."
165,165,"Man grabs child’s neck and mother calls police for help

Police: why don’t you teach your son not to litter"
166,166,The officer did the right thing.
167,167,YEAAAH!!! that officer needs a raise!! What a true American hero!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
168,168,They definitely deserve restitution. Cop was very sus
169,169,This makes me lose faith in humanity.
170,170,this cop is hero
171,171,Why can’t everyone just be equal
172,172,These cops think it’s against the law to disrespect a cop
173,173,im glad they were arrested. Teach your kids not to litter
174,174,"System ain’t for us y’all. I see animals living in beech houses getting treated like royalty while the homeless struggle 

Let’s not forget the selective all lives matter people"
175,175,police reviewed this and found no wrong doing
176,176,Good police work.
177,177,We need time to rug sweep and threaten witnesses!
178,178,Let me tell you black people something as long as you don’t stick together with each other I don’t care where you are in the world right now this will always happen we have to stick together if you scared to die at least prepare to die behind your children behind your own respect even if you dont value yourself let’s protect these children Vista cops are being trained to take the black community down all we have is each other 
179,179,Id suggest Blacks police blacks see how that goes
180,180,"OMFG, if this vid is unedited, this Officer had no right to grab that poor teen girl :O Like, WTF!! WHY??!!"
181,181,They are just being ordered to do this thing because there is not logical explanation on why police officers repeatedly behave like this for decades and decades.
182,182,I feel justice wasn't served. The animals were released from jail.
183,183,So we're damned when we call the cops. And we're damned when we don't
184,184,To be fair in this video it can be very unclear to what actually happened before the start of the incident and it does seem like they were giving the officer problems.
185,185,Lol cop came there with an goal in mind.
186,186,Child abuse is the law!! If he placed his hand on a child.... ️
187,187,Defend yourself and your family. Period.
188,188,Why do some cops think they have more power than everyone LIKE PIPE DOWN
189,189,The priority should always be to de escalate the situation
190,190,the young girl that got between the cop and her mama just trying to keep calm her mom down don't know why the cop grabbed the teen
191,191,Always record so you can see the truth!!!!!!!!!
192,192,Abuse of power
193,193,Wow. Bet you she won't call police again!
194,194,"The kids are out of control, everyone thinks it is ok for them to destroy property, through trash all over the place. the guy should just move."
195,195,"They need to release the entire video,  not just the part that makes her look like a victim...

The tone in which they speak to officers need to change, as well as, the officers' approach to dealing with black people..."
196,196,The fifteen-year-old daughter stepped up to address her mother and the police officer attacked her.
197,197,at least he didnt shoot her through his partners door
198,198,I'm just a child but I just want to say god made us all the same to leave in peace and love and that's what they think peace and love is to harm us because of how God makes our skin colour. That's mest up
199,199,"This is what popped up at the top when I searched ""cops being cool with black people"""
200,200,"The child abusing racist neighbor had a good laugh, he too needs to be sued."
201,201,"The police have no rules so they feel like they bounds….sad sad …he arrested that little girl…she looks like she is in high school and she will always remember this.
Power to my people "
202,202,What happened to the assault case by the man choking the child??
203,203,Stop breaking the law
204,204,Resisting arrest there was no crime to be arrested for in the first place
205,205,This is getting scary.
206,206,"Black women: calls 911 for help
Cop: why did he litter"
207,207,Bro I don’t care u touch my mom like that for no good reason I don’t care if u a cop or not I’m going to fight you bruh
208,208,"Lesson! If you black DONT call the cops on a white man!!!

You will be arrested. It’s not your right to do so!!!"
209,209,arrested for resisting arrest.... my god..
210,210,Absolutely disgraceful.
211,211,Were ever did he tackle him lol
212,212,Where are the real cops? This Guy has no business in law enforcement
213,213,My dreams of being a cop are crushed
214,214,The pandemic has got me watching police arresting people.
215,215,WHAT is there to investigate.....REALLY
216,216,Is this even a police?
217,217,But what were they even arrested for can he arrest them if they just get him mad
218,218,He really said why don’t you teach your son not to litter instead of the fact a man choked a child wow
219,219,Fire the fkn guy and investigate---independently. He completely ignored the possibility that the guy out his hands on her child.
220,220,That man has the complexion for protection. Let’s not act surprised.
221,221,Note to self don't ever call the cops for help
222,222,Haha!! Yess. Love it
223,223,Ok this is edited. Without the full Video of the cam foootag of the cop(if it exists) this video says nothing
224,224,It's trouble broke out now everybody's attacking the cop I guess he is just doing what he's doing now I wouldn't have to do that way but if it's trouble broke out I'm just going to do me
225,225,He did use the taser at 1:08 you can see the daughter on the ground and the police pointing the gun at her.
226,226,If I were a cop I'd be terrified to work the hood. Nah yall can have that
227,227,There’s no substance to this. And the vid is cut up to make it look like a specific viewpoint.
228,228,"She went at him, cant tell shea a child dressed like that. Keep crying about the cop getting away with it because he will. Keep crying. Its funny"
229,229,just another cop that got away with abuse.
230,230,"Me: *being kinda tan*

wait- hol’ up does that count as black-"
231,231,Give them a badge and a gun and they think they're above the law.
232,232,I hope they sued.
233,233,Stop calling police. Catch his arse slipping. Handle that.
234,234,I saw the video of the cop on body cam he didnt tackle
235,235,How can u charge soneone with resisting arrestlike seriously how is that a crime
236,236,Teach them not to throw trash on the ground.... yet that officer was out of line
237,237,Somebody should have jumped in and help that woman.
238,238,You call the police that’s what you get!
239,239,What we learn guys? Never call the Police in the usa
240,240,An they wonder why they did that shooting in Texas smh️
241,241,I want a fkng follow up !!!
242,242,People are innocent till proven guilty
243,243,"Why don't you guys just call the police??

......."
244,244,When help goes
245,245,I wonder what's his sheet of choice to wear over his head after his shift is over? 
246,246,"yea but you cant go screaming and attacking the cop, she just dont know how to act like a grown up, and thats a good thing"
247,247,"How would he like for someone to handle his wife, mother, or sister that way?  He would not like that, so stop attacking black women like that.  Coward."
248,248,the kid who littered pushed the cop
249,249,"The USA is crazy , crazy  i tell ya!"
250,250,WE ON LIVE!  WE ON LIVE!
251,251,Love it! I want to see more of this
252,252,"Is not up to y'all he is going to face charges putting in his hands on a child just like the same dynamic if it was someone that was not black he will face charges, in the city needs to be sued if he's not dismissed off the force better yet they need to do an audit on all his police files and public records to try to come and get his license to where he cannot go to another law enforcement agency to work ever again he's violated his oath clearly we can see that "
253,253,All I heard was that we identified a child molester and the police and the city arrested one of the victims.
254,254,Why were acting a fools I’m glad they all got arrested just because you’re black doesn’t give you the right To assault a police officer
255,255,Hahaha
256,256,I lose faith in humanity every hour we all stray further from god every day unknowing black people are the same as white racism should not exist and slavery should have never happened we are all children of god we should not fight or steal we should all just be nice we are all human so please if you agree stand up for man kind no matter what color shape or size have a great day and god bless you
257,257,Please allow us 1-3 years to determine if this officer is justified.
258,258,Does he get fired ? Shame on system if he stay as community protective. He is looser
259,259,“Why don’t you teach your son not to litter?”
260,260,I think that was bull crap. I didn't see it as racial as another over bearing cop. Would have liked to seen whole video. The daughter was only trying to settle her Mom down. A lot of police think they're are above the law.
261,261,HE SAYS THANKS...HE GOT A PAID VACATION!!!!
262,262, very nice
263,263,Ft  worth... LOL i knew that was going to happen to her. They wrote the book on racist policing.
264,264,VIOLATION OF OATH OF OFFICE. CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.
265,265,This cop is evil 
266,266,"Girl tried to calm her mom, she was facing her mon and not the cop. Cop acted too poorly"
267,267,Disgusting
268,268,How tf the camera person get arrested?????
269,269,"Thats why im not calling police, even when im near death"
270,270,"Us: I don’t think they’re racist to black man
Soldier in East Indies: YOU SOLDIER HAVE TO BE BLACK
YES
BE FEARLESS"
271,271,
272,272,Wow
273,273,each case is different.  some cops are right.  some cops are wrong.  this cop is beyond wrong
274,274,Cops just doing cop things.
275,275,Don't call the police every time.
276,276,"Black person - Calls 911

Police - 911 what is your emergency "
277,277,Cop should be fired. Mom showed no violence just angry and the guy put his hands on the son.
278,278,I will never need the police
279,279,Honestly it makes me cry that people bash are race so much sometimes i wish i wasnt my own race it makes me sick to my stomach that i will be hated by people wherever i go
280,280,Who is the person recording this and why didn’t they stop this?
281,281,"she ain’t “yelling”, people from hood talks like that."
282,282,"That's RAAAACIST
Greetings from Poland 🇵🇱"
283,283,"I am starting to not like the color of my skin (white), i wish the cop all the worst."
284,284,Thats why I believe a dead  is the best ... HAHAHAHA...
285,285,why aren’t they training the cops properly
286,286,
287,287,Smh
288,288,"He got bullied growing up
Lame"
289,289,Wow
290,290,don’t yell at cops
291,291,He was scared
292,292,"Just remember the police are only here to hep you. If you believe that, I have a bridge for sale."
293,293,I subscribed
294,294,Not a reasonable arrest at all. The cop is tweaking!
295,295,Standing several yards away using a camera is now a crime?  Cops investigating cops.  Any bets as to the result?  I used to be strongly pro police no matter what.  I now look at each incidrnt.
296,296,Maybe she should learn how to talk to a police officer
297,297,Send that cop one way ticket to vidor tx
298,298,
299,299,Then people say don’t call police for help when we need it - Because we know how they treat us when we do.
300,300,"10 years later, the department is satisfied nothing wrong occured"
301,301,I mean y’all just prove you’re not civil and are not biologically capable of it
302,302,So...what’s the problem? If anyone grabbed a cop you’re gonna get it
303,303,"there are no exceptions if someone acts racist in my country, let alone from law enforcement. society is more savage than the police themselves. they are not afraid of your gun. that's why my country has many races and live together"
304,304,Not the same protection?? Yea they get better!!
305,305,To be honest in this clip the police was wrong. Most police officer I know usually try to calm down the situation but instead this police officer raised the attention. Second of all the lady wasn’t even being aggressive or even harming anybody she was just complaining Also why did arrest the person recording their allowed to record in public for their safety. Third you can see that the police officer was being bias and not actually trying to resolve the problem. Lastly the cop just straight up just charged at the women’s for no reason.
306,306,No justice was not served charge that little kid for littering
307,307,
308,308,Basically nothing gonna happen
309,309,I FONT BELIEVE THAT DRAMA!
310,310,If I was that cop I would have thrown that guy 2 the ground not the women smh
311,311,O my God
312,312,That cop should be fired and punished
313,313,Man...this is gonna get buried
314,314,A black woman thought the cops would help her?
315,315,Never call the police.
316,316,Ahahah omg only in america
317,317,Lesson learned Dont call the cops fir stupid stuff like this

319,319,Fire this guy and his trainers.
320,320,"Wtf why is racist a thing I mean were all the same 
Citezens,police officers,actors,youtubers,readers"
321,321,"All these comments are so dumb, they are just stating what's happening and putting a sad or crying emoji after."
322,322,Simply.. Thats not how you talk to an officer
323,323,OMG she was totally right! Her daughter didn't do anything and they both get arrested! RACISM AT ITS FINEST.
324,324,"Cops get away again, whats new."
325,325,"Ok bad cops gives the police foce a bad name. 
Thats why people think all cops are evil becuase of bad cops. Not all cops are like this. It depends on the type of human they are, bad or good."
326,326,Bit what's the full story cause I pretty sure most people know that news stations kinda don't show it
327,327,It's  going to be ok
328,328,"The police are to much arrogant people and sometime i think that police need 1-2 hour yoga to stay calm in hard situation ,,,, these police can't control her Emotion and high pressure ,,need a healthy mental control too"

334,334,Don’t litter though haha
335,335,This is still happening  I dont like cops
336,336,Now yall kno why we run
337,337,I should say a majority of cop studies
338,338,Why was person recording arrested?
339,339,So this was 3 years ago. Does anyone know if the officer got punished or not?
340,340,"I wonder if they investigated themselves & found no wrongdoing, as usual?"
341,341,Kostner and easy Lego kits keep on laughing to keep them in line

351,351,That cop is messed up and he looks like WallaWugi from Mario
352,352,Wow disgusting I hope that cop was fired and charged
353,353,Next time ask dispatch for a non racist officer
354,354,"The girl that is 15 was trying to break up the argument, that is stupid that he arrested her for no reason."
355,355,"throw card #1, racism woohoooo"
356,356,Tell the real story.

360,360,Its sad racism is still in america :(
361,361,"Cop definitely needs to find a new career, police work was not made for him"
362,362,Opposite meets opposite and abuse of power. Ignorance and confusion.
363,363,Excessive force? Not enough force I say . She was still breathing.
364,364,Wtf hahaha lol
365,365,I am going to warn message from God him self this most be stop else he is going to stop it.

368,368,This is why you see some ppl missing body parts putting you hands on the wrong person kids.

373,373,Where is the proof he hurt her son?
374,374,"This cop need to be arrested, and never see a badge in his racist lift again. I see much worst coming if he stay on the force."
375,375,That cop a bum
376,376,It was a felony offense to arrest the camera person
377,377,What in de worlds naam have dis world begaim literally i police officer arest i black woman our man doesn't matter just bie gus she is black dat doesn't matter only if she did something bad den u can arrest her and collers doesn't matter its love i don't know whats people problem same times
378,378,Well what a surprise…….not!
379,379,"Lets throw race out the window, the man who was 'assulting' the daughter could of been stopped if she never littered, plus it was a stupid thing to call the police for, and that usually some people say that its all about the racial problems, ITS NOT. It is about more than that. Plus it was probably in the officers codex or something on how to handle a useless call. That was the wrong way, maybe he was a rookie, but that is not a excuse to use racial problems in this. I think that they keep talking about what happened centuries ago. The slavery and they keep calling arrests that are LEGAL assault, besides the African American people do deserve rights and do have them, they just sometimes talk about the racial problems too much."

People aren't having the time of their lives when they have to call 911.

Shame on these cops ruining the reputation of the force"

523,523,The woman got angry and was yelling at the cop. At that time the cop hadent done anything wrong and then a random girl entered the mittle of them and so ths cop grabed the womans shoulders and tried to move her out of the way so he could solve the main problem but the girl resisted the cop and then the girl that was yelling at the cop tryed to pull the cop of the other girls and so the cop arrested her. Cop did nothign wrong.
524,524,This is why blacks don’t call the cops
525,525,Hey black lives matter
526,526,You can’t ask your racist oppressor for help.
527,527,GF
528,528,The officer deserves a double tap for his troubles.
529,529,"What else is there to investigate?its clear  whatthe policeman did..
Police Department just wont say sorry and fire the man"
530,530,"these black people should be treated with respect,they are not slaves ,not that the race should ever been slaves,its not a humane practice"

553,553,Lookin like a blue whale
554,554,I hate the police. That officer got his feelings hurt because this woman put him in his place and he could not handle it. Very unprofessional. Mcdonalds employees are more proffesional than this human garbage.
555,555,Hi
556,556,Lol ha ha
557,557,Littering is a crime and it doesn't pay 
558,558,Why don’t more blacks join the police force? Police their own community? I always wondered that.

567,567,Dquf
568,568,Anyone else think that cop was arresting a walrus? Lmao
569,569,"Why would he do that? I mean, she was only yelling at him obnoxiously, causing a intense situation"

589,589,That cop wasn't having the atittude
590,590,if they dont like america why not move to africa? life is surely better there....
591,591,But why did the kid litter in the first place?
592,592,What a chump.  Why don't you teach your kids not to litter?
593,593,It is just basic racial profiling but nothing personal. A black person is more likely to be a criminal so there is a higher change to make a right arrest arresting her. In the big picture few wrong arrests don’t matter if you get most of them right. Of course it is a nuisance to an individual but from the society’s point of wiev it is better to be safe than sorry. Law enforcement need to look at the big picture and that is why racial profiling and other tools are in the use to make the work easier and more efficient.
594,594,Based officer
595,595,She deserved it ! Big mouth !
596,596,Its soo funny how she talks in the video vs how the speaks in front of the cameras... please educate your kids! And follow the rules you don't scream to the authorities.. it's not about race it's about manners!!
597,597,Ummmmm he wouldn't arrest her if she stopped yelling at him. And the family saying that cops targets black people WTF well she's the wrong person....
598,598,Proud of you. She deserves it.
599,599,Guy shouldn’t have touched the child and the child shouldn’t have littered both were in the wrong
600,600,Shut  up and obey the law
601,601,Learn to Respect the law and them  you can yell.
602,602,The cop did the right thing.
603,603,we are Israelite's people read the bible
604,604,These women should be arrested just for screaming like that
605,605,"Do not believe this lie I am an Arab, I lived in America, New Jersey and New York, the best police in dealing is the American police, they have justice"
606,606,When will us blacks get justice. This isn't right
607,607,She deserved it
608,608,Ha
609,609,Where is the racism? Didn’t hear or see anything racist in this video. Loud mouth mama got body slammed.
610,610,The cop is kinda right
611,611,America is such a horrible place.
612,612,"The cop was right, woman was out of line."
613,613,That's not a woman . that's a whale.
614,614,Act stupid and get treated that way. Act civilized and there won't be a problem!
615,615,"Cop did nothing wrong.;Ever since Obama was in the white house, black people are untouchable. Case in point. In my local starbucks a black man came in and started yelling at employees for no reason and was cusing and calling names and dirty names to all the women employees and throwing coffee bags around and destroying the whole store. No body dared to call the police, because if they did and the man got arrested, within hours, riots would erupt outside the store, windows would be broken and probably the building would be set on fire. When the guy left, the store was emptied and closed down for remodeling."
616,616,Yea no not racist this just a bad cop stop confusing words with obvious bad actions people but people who's moral compass was wrong. Cop bad but not racist please refer back in 1900.s what racist was.
617,617,start teaching your kids not to litter.  Black hate being confronted about their dirty ways.
0,0,"I went to Japan, I couldn’t speak Japanese but police officers were very kind. A language barrier is no excuse to break someone’s neck."
1,1,"As an American, I am so angered and ashamed about this.
My Indian brothers and sisters, please do not hate all of us for the actions of only a few. That cop is a coward!"
2,2,"How disgusting. Westerners treat old people so horribly. In India (or any Asian country) we would never treat the elderly so violently. Seeing them harm such a fragile old man is so painful. 

That officer is filth."
3,3,In my country many people walk around my house and I don't call the police. It's normal to see people walking in the street to take fresh air. In America it is ABNORMAL!
4,4,After everything the old man isn't angry that's how wise he is
5,5,"If that attorney visits India and doesn't speak Hindi, we'll be sure to break his back"
6,6,"In America, they call the cops on innocent strangers walking on streets."
7,7,"I feel so bad about this frail guy that my tears came out, he looks very humble and polite😥"
8,8,Everyone's hating on the police officer. I think the person who called police on him is equally responsible.
9,9,"Caller: there is a guy walking down the street
Cops: That’s not illegal, what’s the problem?
Caller: He’s Black
Cops: Avengers Assemble!"
10,10,This is the level of freedom. Can't even take morning walk.
11,11,"""When you come to the US, WE expect you to follow our laws and speak our language. Mr. Patel bears as much reponsability for this as anyone"" 
Those words makes my blood to boil!!! That is raw RACISM and DISCRIMINATION on its purest form. Only an arrogant ignorant could say that!!!  A lot of people like me came to US to work and find a better quality of life. No be harrased by anyone claiming to be more American than me for not being born in the Continental United States. Whoever wrote that statement is a complete arrogant ignorant. The United Stated was founded by inmigrants centuries ago and America's skycrapers, train roads and so on were built by inmigrants. Mr. Patel said ""India, no English"". For the cop that was enough reason to treat an old man walking on the curbside of the street like a gang member or junkie bearing a weapon. How many cops do you need to slam to the ground an old man and send him to the hospital? You just need to count how many bully cowards are on the video next to Mr. Patel. They should pay for his hospital expenses. A women got 6 million dollars for being burnt with hot cofee at McDonald's. Why Mr. Patel should get less? Because he's from India and speak no English? It's a shame!!!"
12,12,Sometimes I am so disgusted and ashamed of my country.... God bless that man...he's lucky to be alive...many people are murdered by our police each year.
13,13,"There must be thousands of Indians in Australia. They are very polite, many are well educated and many are tertiary students. Most speak English better than us. I cannot recall any news item about them committing crimes.They are sometimes victims of racist Australians."
14,14,"How on earth can this gentle, kind man be deemed a threat?? We really do live in a very crazy world. I dearly hope the officer is rightly sentenced!"
15,15,"So tired of hearing ""Officer safety"" If you are this afraid of another individual do not be a cop. Its may be a risky job at times. Sick of these tyrants."
16,16,"How can they do this to innocent person? After all of these,he is so calm and not seemed angry. Such a great person."
17,17,Everyone of those officers should be fired and sued and the department should pay for his medical bills. He feared for his safety from a trail old man?!?!😠
18,18,The cop is not in jail and we lecture other countries about human rights.
19,19,"My heart just dropped when they toss that frail man in the ground at 2:05
Is this not excessive force? Shameful. This police officer stinks of racism."
20,20,"Go for a walk. Gets neck broke. US, land of the insane."
21,21,How can someone hurt an innocent old man.
22,22,"The jury is a representation of America’s conscience, they ultimately failed to hold this man accountable. 3rd degree is literally letting him walk free"
23,23,"A developed country , eh ????😐.
We Indians do fight within ourselves but we welcome each and every foreigner."
24,24,"""We expect you to follow our laws and speak our language.""
He broke no laws, and America has no official language. And not speaking English isn't an excuse to crack someone's neck, I'm pretty sure that's called xenophobia."
25,25,The caller should also be charged as an accessory.
26,26,"you cant break an old mans back and then just say 
“oh sorry he didnt speak english”"
27,27,Just another fine example of the police protecting and defending your constitutional rights
28,28,Hope you make a full recovery Mr Patel. Hope that thug of a policeman serves time for what he did to you.
29,29,"Americans visiting india , first learn almost 30-40 indian Language before entering india...we have police too ."
30,30,Prayers for him this is so heartbreaking 😪
31,31,"Old guy: I'm indian
Every other nation: Ok. No threat here..have a good day sir.
US: let's flip him"
32,32,You know what....in India we speak 32 languages and 1500 dialects and we are doing completely fine. We dont break people's neck for not knowing.....America you need to accept people and stop being defensive.
33,33,Stay strong Mr. Patel. I've gotten PTSD (thankfully getting over it now) from a crime made up against me by cops.
34,34,This is the time for this case to be reopened. Let us demand justice !
35,35,"A 27 year old dude brought down an old skinny man ,fearing for his safety ...... sounds pretty legit 🤔"
36,36,"Hmmm.  According to the defense, even a foreign mute person would therefore be expected to speak ""Our language"".  
But at least if the defense attorney goes on holiday in a country in which he does not speak that language, then they now know how to treat him."
37,37,"This is sickening! The officer deserves much worse, couldn’t reach a verdict? All white jury ??"
38,38,Disturbing behaviour form people who are supposed to be custodians of the law.
39,39,"""Land of the Free and Home of the Brave"" What a laugh!"
40,40,"Two huge physically fit guys tackling an old weak man with no weapons to the ground and giving reason ""officer safety"". Yeah right!!"
41,41,"Slow claps for the cop. YOU ARE THE MAN. Great job buddy, that's how we should treat people who don't speak our language. Thanks for opening my eyes."
42,42,"""When you come to the US we expect you to follow our laws and speak our language. Mr Patel bears as much responsibility for this as anyone.""
- Robert Tuten, Defense Attorney"
43,43,This hurts me very hard I hate seeing fragile people being targeted and hurt dude deserves compensation. He was totally racially profiled. Somehow a handkerchief can do sooo much damage
44,44,What an absolutely beautiful man! It breaks my heart that he was assaulted and didn’t get justice. I hope he’s fully healed by now
45,45,"Just wanted to know if a Tourist comes in to USA, he should learn English ?  If YES, then you all must be very careful when you come to India then, we have  29 States and ALL speak a DIFFERENT LANGUAGE."
46,46,"""He acted in the interest of officer safety"" - How by breaking the neck of a 90 pound old man?"
47,47,I feel very disconnected from the ways our cops and states behave. I think all humans deserve freedom and liberty.
48,48,"I remember this, and want to say there was no excuse for the police to throw him to the ground. They could not have feared for their own safety. The person who called them to begin with had no reason to do so. I want to say that I am an older person, too, if they threw me to the ground I would be broken, also."
49,49,"""Land of the free"" wow what a great land 😡😡"
50,50,"What a shameful decision by the judge, the video shows clearly the level of violence this police officer did to this poor guy!"
51,51,"I'm so sorry that you had to go through that Mr Patel, unfortunately our country happens to be racist and we are working on it."
52,52,"""a skinny black guy"" enough said"
53,53,"I am so disgusted. This man was assaulted three times. First by the caller, second by the officer and third by the courts. What has happened to humanity in the U.S.?"
54,54,"It's sad to see videos like this. nobody deserves to be treated that way, he reminds me of my grandfather who came from Punjab, India I can't imagine someone treating him like this"
55,55,What shocks me is that there is no justice/conviction despite clear evidence of unprovoked brutality towards an old man.
56,56,"As soon as I saw this video I was 100% sure hate comments will follow from both ends. 

I agree what was done was terrible and a peaceful solution was possible. One thing Americans should understand is that, we Indians are peace lovers. We do not cause harm intentionally when we are on foreign soil. Also we respect the country we visit or stay in."
57,57,I felt so good when I heard that the 'Cop has got fired'.
58,58,"Wow I'm Pakistani and Indian people are our neighbours and family, when I first came to the U.S there was this Swedish guy who also said no English I wander why he  wasn't arrested by the cops or a jury saying ur expected to know are language"
59,59,"A few years back, a great big policeman shouldered me from behind as I was waiting in the line to see a celebrity arriving.   I was agony and I suffered frozen shoulder as a result.  Those days I was weak.  Didn’t argue, I respected the police.  Seeing this video, I just felt a bitter taste in my mouth.  Oh my GOD.  HE is an old man.   Someone’s father.  Hero of the day, throwing a WEAK old man to the ground."
60,60,The person who called 911 should also be arrested tell the people the phone callers name
61,61,"1) They didn't provide PC (probable cause) for an arrest or RAS (reasonable, articulable suspicion of a crime) needed for detainment.
2) they didnt have PC or RAS
3) You need PC to demand ID or personal info. in a stop and ID state, you still need RAS"
62,62,"This cruel police officer calls an elderly man ""bud"" shows this police officer has no respect for the elderly. 

How can police interrogate and detain a man who's merely walks on a road?"
63,63,Been in Ukraine. Policemen in Kharkiv used to comes stand straight salute us and ask respectfully our id if needed.
64,64,"Police officer Eric Parker, who is accused of injuring Patel, was fired from the Madison Police Department and charged with third-degree assault but was reinstated into the force in 2016. In March 2015, Parker was charged by the FBI with felony civil rights abuse, but was later acquitted of all charges."
65,65,When this happened no one said a word against this nor made any protest
66,66,I am from Pakistan and I really feel very sorry for you.It was unacceptable and rude by policeman
67,67,"When I first hear about things like this after learning about the whole story I usually take the police officer side because I find most people like to embellish and exaggerate about how they are treated by the police....

In this case the police officer handle the situation the wrong way."
68,68,My heart goes out to you sir
69,69,I see...so because Mr. Patel can't speak English he bears some of the responsibility for having the police break his neck. TRULY AMAZING!
70,70,"Poor man! I hope he recovers soon! This is what happens when power influences small minded, racist idiots!"
71,71,It's absolutely dreadful what police officer did too this man and he should be put in prison
72,72,"In France, the man would go to the police station and a translator would come. Why always violence ? These cases mostly happen in the USA, maybe police school should programs should be changed."
73,73,bless him! hope he fully recovers!
74,74,"""he didn't mean to hurt Mr. Patel!"" Yeah, the officer  wanted to give Mr. Patel a  massage? Lmao"
75,75,"what ever you do, don't walk around town on the sidewalks because it is for "" OFFICERS SAFETY "" that we may have to break your neck..."
76,76,"A settlement was made this year in a law suit, he was awarded 1.75 million dollars in damages

unfortunately the officer got away without any convictions whatsoever and was even given his job back, but this is almost always the case when it comes to court cases against the police, they can literally get away with cold blooded murder"
77,77,This is absolutely asinine . The man is not required to speak English and is protected by the US constitution. His rights were violated on so many different levels it is absolutely pathetic. The cop claims he threw the man to the ground for officer Saftey what a joke. Just because you don’t speak English and you are out for a walk does not give the cops the right to assault you.                                   I am glad the cop was fired now the city needs to pony up several million dollars in damages for the assault.
78,78,"The caller should have some responsibility too.  You cant just call the police every time you see a person you dont know in your neighborhood, ridiculous!"
79,79,What a tough guy that officer is taking down a elderly man.
80,80,I don't know on wtf these Americans are so proud of
81,81,"How can they even push the old men like he’s a 20 year old men? Even if you do find a 
weapon you shouldn’t be using such force on a elderly Jesus!"
82,82,You can tell from the eyes of Eric Parker that he is harbouring a lot of hate and hostility. Dude's worst enemy is his mind and his worst punishment is having to live with it.
83,83,"""We expect you to follow our laws and speak our language."" The US does not have an official language."
84,84,Get well soon ! Love from Canada ❤
85,85,Notice how the cop looked straight at his dash cam as soon as he put the old man on the ground he knew he fucked up
86,86,"That cop should be charged with attempted murder. If you body slam a elderly man half his size, with that force, what you think it's going to happen."
87,87,Hold All Police Law Enforcement Accountable For Their Action !!!!!
88,88,"Wow! What bravery! 
I suggest that he be given the highest police honour for successfully overpowering an unarmed, skinny, frail, old man to uphold law and order!
😀😀😀😀"
89,89,how could you NOT reach a unaminous decision?  that was extreme force
90,90,"Parker was charged with 3rd degree assault, he should have been charged with attempted murder."
91,91,"Same in the UK. The police are so fired up and apparently many of them are too stupid to assess a situation.

Mr Patel is clearly a frail elderly man. There was absolutely no need to take him down like that."
92,92,"In my opinion he just wanted to use that new move he learnt on a ""how to be a cool cop"" instruction video"
93,93,Im mad and sad this man could had been the cop's father!!!
94,94,"Bloody hell.  Regardless of anything, how can you throw an old man to the ground? That's insane, you must know it could kill them."
95,95,What sickings me is that the other police don't try and stop it
96,96,"Why don't these cops just sign up for MMA, if they want to fight so bad? That was a peaceful old frail man. He posed no threat at all to anyone."
97,97,I am an indian selected in  a US university I'm thinking 1000 times before even leaving india and this just makes it another reason to not go there 😌. I know we are developing country but the police do respect the elders here .
98,98,"This is so crazy man, it's haunting my thoughts to see how a son must have felt when he saw his father on the ground with that kind of force, which wasn't needed. Indian or Indians are way safe people, they are mostly vegeterian, cultured, humble, above all if that father stopped on police request, he was obeying the officers how come they turned him upside down. How come others feel safe in America, it's better to stay in India..."
99,99,Just come to India we shall teach in the language you understand. 👊💥👊💥
100,100,And the US talks about human rights... Wow slow claps
101,101,Hold All Police Law Enforcement Accountable For Their Action !!!!!
102,102,Last year I went to Moscow Russia for a business trip. By mistake I entered a no entry side walk as some construction was going on since I wouldnt read the Russian signboard.. But the cops didn't brake my neck instead they humbly told me to take the alternative route in English...
103,103,"This is indefensible. The man was visiting from a foreign country, frail, and did everything in his power to make it clear to the officers that he did not understand them. What were the officers expecting him to do exactly?"
104,104,2:06 Omg! 😱 That was uncalled for.
105,105,The title should be USA police paralysed a guy for not knowing a language .( Oh btw according to the law  he didn't need to know English to walk on the streets of USA )
106,106,Clearly that man didn't look like he was hiding a weapon in his pants unless he is capable of doing serious damage with a handkerchief. I just think he was a new officer trying too hard to look good to his department and it just fired back. This could have been anybody who was taking a stroll down the road. Nowhere is it written that you would have to speak or converse in English in order to get into inside the United States. That's why they have interpreters for all languages.
107,107,"To this granddad, I'm so sorry 💔 that you were treated like trash by the police in our country, prayers for you and your family I hope your grandbaby and you get better. This is why we don't trust the police"
108,108,He's brave. I am too scared to move out of my state without a job lined up.
109,109,"""Son doesn't feel angry""  Dudes a better man then me."
110,110,"Had they taken strict action then,  George Floyd case wouldn't have happened"
111,111,"This is awful, the way this man was treated. No excuse. Excessive and completely unnecessary force."
112,112,"Many of our police are former combat military Veterans. As a Veteran myself I am perfectly aware that the conflicts/war in the middle East and out political climate have resulted in intolerance/prejudice  in our military force. This officer, and the many like them are an embarrassment to this Country."
113,113,I am so sorry to his family members to go through like that.
114,114,Who is here after George Floyd death
115,115,Hold All Police Law Enforcement Accountable For Their Action !!!!!!!
116,116,"This is US, disregard of human values but preacher to the world. In pursuit of material happiness lost everything of being human."
117,117,"The United States has no official language. English is the language of England, not the United States."
118,118,"Hero: 911 there's a black man walking through the streets.. Oh wait I think he's brown
Police: doesn't matter
Hero: long live America
Police: here I come sir"
119,119,"That was way too brutal, there was absolutely no reason to throw him onto the floor"
120,120,"“Wow that Indian guy is intimidating!” 
- No one ever."
121,121,Hold All Police Law Enforcement Accountable For Their Action !!!!!
122,122,Hold All Police Law Enforcement Accountable For Their Action !!!!!!!
123,123,"When an Indian like me watch America 🇺🇸 I used to see - 1) Opportunities 
2) Culture 
3) Power
4) Innovation 💡 "
124,124,"""Land of free and brave"" a citizen can't even walk on street without permission 🤣🤣🤣"
125,125,"Well, Mr Patel looks very dangerous. He's Indian, he told the cops he was Indian and even told them 148, thats my house,148. The defence lawyer said "" when you come to America, you have to follow our laws and speak english"".  The poor defence lawyer, howcan he stoop so low.
The man was talking a walk. American cops are saying your guilty....however, that's before you even get to the police station. Two jurys could not find this cop guilty....I guess they were all ex cops. Shame on America...."
126,126,Hold All Police Law Enforcement Accountable For Their Action !!!!!!
127,127,The act of forcefully throwing someone to the ground invited injury.
128,128,"This is so infuriating. My grandparents when they visited me from Korea, they would stroll around the neighborhood with curiosity because everything is new to them. They will check out some of the neighbor's garden and sometimes yes they would enter their driveways... But to call police on them really? So wrong"
129,129,"How can two healthy police do this to a frail old man!?

And why let your old Father out completely on his own even for a walk, in a foreign land where he does not even understand the local attitude and behaviour of the people nor speak their language!?"
130,130,OH MY GOD WHAT FORCE HE USED ON AN OLD MAN. HE COULD HAVE BEEN DEAD
131,131,"Sorry but who stares out of their window, notices a man that isn't from the neighbourhood and calls the cops"
132,132,I hope the family was compensated for the life changing injuries they caused on mr Patel!
133,133,"I'm glad i'm able to feel safe and sleep at night, knowing we have wonderful Police able to subdue the high threat of unarmed non English speaking frail 58 year old men."
134,134,POLICE DID THAT? AND ON AN OLD MAN WHO CAN BARELY WALK!  WOW.
135,135,"It is heart breaking to treat a peaceful  elderly man and make him disable.  For the defense lawyer who said that Mr. Patel should speak english and respect US laws and culture, let me remind that your great, great  gerat European granfathers when they come to US, they did not speak english, nor understand US culture."
136,136,I tried calling the cops and literally I have someone trying to injure and hurt me but they never ever showed up. I called the emergency department multiple times and the lady said have you been hurt yet and I said no and she says why r you calling the police then if its not an urgent matter and you haven't been assaulted. Meanwhile the police show up because this guy is taking a walk. Shame on the police department in Canada and USA. Double standards
137,137,"Disgusting, racist. 
Use of power for not knowing English. 
This act must be condemned. 
The officer should have been punished."
138,138,"May Allah give him healing, justice and ease. That video is heartbreaking. Police training needs to be changed in this country. I can’t believe the argument of the defense. DISGUSTING."
139,139,What frustrates me more is the jury being unable to reach a unanimous decision.
140,140,Precisely why I would never go to the country of violent insane people who are scared of their own shadows.
141,141,Hold All Police Law Enforcement Accountable For Their Action !!!!!!!
142,142,"This would have been terrifying for this man. I can't imagine. He's stronger than I am, I would've gone back home after that. Not all Americans are bigots. I'm sorry your introduction to American ""culture"" was in such an horrific manner ❤️"
143,143,the jury failed to reach a decision .. why ! was they all cops on the jury !
144,144,We all can be a little sensitive and respectful to an elderly person
145,145,"If I called the cops to tell them that an old man walks through my neighborhood every day, they'd be like; and?"
146,146,"Mr. Patel, Put a petition out to prosecute this law abuser, Many many will sign it."
147,147,"As a retired UK officer I can't believe how often I see these aggressive attacks on US citizens by American police. Many of these offices seem to lack the skill of downplaying situations using verbal communications and  instead go into an offensive aggressive mode, making matters much worse for both parties. Many of the videos I've seen come across as a police force  being more a force than a police service, totally out of control and are verging on a military dictatory  force seen in many third world countries. Of course not all officers are like this, but the perception destroys all the good work done by officers trying their best to help their communities."
148,148,The sad thing is this type of incident would happen again some where in the US. Officers should get enough details before make decisions that might impact to everyone.
149,149,"""when you come to the US we expect you to follow our laws and speak our language..."" - Robert Tuten, Defense Attorney.

Wow, just wow! And how many average Americans who travel to a country where English is not an official language can speak ""their"" language??? 🙄"
150,150,"See this is how I feel,  if notice cops seem to do this only when a person is being held so they can't defend yourself or if they deemed you to be a person who can't defend themselves or there is 5 to 10 cops."
151,151,Come to India u.s people I'll teach you a lesson... For not speaking hindi 🦈
152,152,"Literally moves 1 inch 

gets slammed to ground"
153,153,"I can't imagine why the family wouldn't be angry , I would be definitely looking for revenge of some kind.It was a vicious attack especially when the cop knew the poor man had no idea what was being asked of him. The other cops on scene had nothing to say or do about the behavior of their buddy....they deserve punishment too."
154,154,"Shame on the person who called the police.  I hope you're proud of yourself.  You really made the world a better, safer place with that move."
155,155,Scary to think how my parents or any of my Asian family member could just be doing their morning walk and cops like these would do them harm for no reason at all.
156,156,Sue the police forcce for damages. May he heal completely. 🙏
157,157,Follow our laws... The man was walking on the side walk. Smh what law was he not following? Or breaking?
158,158,"We have a lot of Americans coming to the Netherlands each year.
OMFG, do we have a lot of neck breaking to do."
159,159,"Even after all this happened to him, he is not angry.🙏"
160,160,using force against An Old skinny grandpa ! what a brave officer! it seems an animal is there inside the cop's uniform .
161,161,"But you are not suppose to slam someone so hard on the ground. Cuff the person, but don't assault. You are too a human, try to understand and respect the power you have as a cop, and this is why people fear cops rather then feel safe around them."
162,162,We're down to rock bottom when it comes to cops in this country.
163,163,i need to be careful when I take my daily stroll. I'm worried someone might call the cops on me.
164,164,"Police had no right to perform custodial detainment, nor right to search him. If a person spoke English and knew their rights, they could have just walked away, without answering any questions — regardless of their citizenship. But a person should not have to be versed in these rights to be under their protection — particularly from police. Once the officer breached his oath and put his hands on the man, he acted criminally, under color of law. The fact that two juries were unable to reach a guilty consensus shows an extreme disregard for the jurors' own individual well-being — in exchange for the well-being of a scumbag LEO. The fact that people in society have become enormous cucks for law enforcement is such an astonishing departure from the principles upon which the United States was founded."
165,165,"A  67  year  old  man,  what  a  danger  to  anyone.
2  blue  coat  bullies. 
What  heros  they  must  be. 
2nd  amendment  people.  USE  IT. "
166,166,why isn't anybody talking about the caller?
167,167,They 100% knew there was a language barrier and they acted criminally anyway.    I don't understand how 2 juries can watch this footage and not find the cop guilty.  What if it was your parent or grandparent that they did that to?
168,168,"It's too bad that mr. Patel was so abused and injured. My sincerest best wishes for him. However, such is the state of law enforcement in the United States. It's nothing new really. It's just the way it is and always has been."
169,169,"News Reporter : ""... here in Alabama""
Me : I get it now, that's enough horror stories for me bud"
170,170,I know officers who are kind and knowledgeable. At the same time there are others who have  opposite behavior. It is all in the head.
171,171,"""When you come to the US we expect you to follow our laws and 'speak our language' "" OMG that so racist"
172,172,"I thought america was the land of freedom where you can you can speak freely, but i guess not"
173,173,"There was a mistrial (2 times i believe).  there were only 2 non-whites 
on there (both supported the victim) but they were outvoted by every1 
else (all white) and eventually the cop was acquitted on all charges. 
even if they fired him: that usually results in cops (or teachers) being hired at another district. "
174,174,"So, in the police officers eyes, it’s legal to break a Grandpa’s neck for not being able speaking English in America?  Would it be legal for someone to break his neck if he decides to go to a foreign country on vacation?  The answer is no.  There is no logic in those words.  The Grandpa communicated that he didn’t know English, obviously, he wouldn’t be able to understand the officer’s requests.  "
175,175,That poor man...No Wonder people frown on the U.S. the way they do. I hope he gets compensated that will pass down for a few generations 🙏
176,176,This is outrageous!!
177,177,Wow... i am speechless...
178,178,"This makes me furious, cant even walk in peace if you so as much as resemble a black person! The man was doing nothing illegal, there was no need for them to even touch this man!!"
179,179,"Guys he was not injured on ""purpose"" when you make unexpected moves in front of US police officers it compromises the safety of the officers and they will act quickly and take you down. None of this was due to racism or being mad at a guy for not speaking english. I feel bad for Mr. Patel but some people just don't know not to make unexpected moves in front of cops."
180,180,"*Gets beaten and body paralysed
Court- You're as much responsible as the guy who beat you up."
181,181,Im an Indian who did his post grads in Texas. I remember a cop coming over to me and my friends with a middle aged North Indian lady who didnt speak any English and was lost there. I acted as the translator and he took her home. The guy was really nice and was very patient with the lady who had been with him for almost an hour when they came over. Thats about all the interaction Ive had with the police in the US.
182,182,Justice and equality for all...
183,183,The cop was driving  around looking for someone whose day he could ruin.
184,184,"So this officer has his job back,  what? How? Why?  Do we loose our rights when we walk out the door for a walk or when we start talking to police,  which is it? Unbelievable!!"
185,185,I love India and had a lot of international student friends I met at UTA in Arlington.
186,186,“He didn’t follow my requests” WTF he doesn’t understand English.
187,187,what is great about the attorney is him saying that they expect you to follow the laws yes the cop should have followed the law shouldnt he have
188,188,I mean in the interview you can see how dangerous he clearly is. Poor officers were obviously terrified for their lives.
189,189,Good job Americans.👍
190,190,"He has no consideration for life, he deserves a prison term of 25 years. It's mindblowing how wreckless individuals can take the seat of a high authority figure and behave like there are no consequences to their actions."
191,191,This country will soon fall apart if the powers that be don't fix this. A person walking down the street or people in traffic stop and other small infraction of the law don't end up with injuries or death.
192,192,American: sees someone who's black or brown. Calls the police.
193,193,"""We expect you to speak our language"" Oh yes, that's my favorite part of the constitution, isn't it right there next to freedom of speech. That's why whenever I visit another country like France, I make sure to learn the full language."
194,194,I pray that he get recovered quick soon.
195,195,"yeah, i found india indian are very proud when they visited us. good luck with these people"
196,196,get well soon Uncle 🤲
197,197,I'm sorry I want to cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
198,198,"Why he was manhandled in the first place?
Pathetic justice system in USA🇺🇸"
199,199,Ah i love watching a video about police in the US and assuming its like this everywhere. Very refreshing
200,200,"This is hilarious to think that ""When you come to the US we expect you to follow our laws and speak our language."" So they gave him a visa to enter the USA regardless of knowing his limited language skills. Why did they let him in then? Excessive force was unnecessary, he didn't seem to show any reason to escape or run. Both cops had him in their grasp without any risk to the officers. This is pure racist and profiling. Also, what is the caller even thinking? So, if we see anyone who is not normal in the area, we have to call the cops? Ridiculous."
201,201,"Man, that was brutal. Acting in the interest of officer safety, my arse! The elderly gentleman didnt have anything threatening on him. Whats wrong with that officer?"
202,202,The fact this elderly Indian man didn't speak English was a justification to break his neck. Wow! I hope the family lawyered up and sued the city and the police.
203,203,I'm disappointed in the police for having done this why should police even come out for a call like this I'm really disappointed.
204,204,"""I've been here for 4 years I saw him doing the same thing ytd too""

Apparently he wasn't there in the neighborhood for 5 days straight and didn't see him taking a stroll"
205,205,"OHHH I’m sure the fact that the caller said Skinny black guy, really didn’t help."
206,206,This is a bad policing. how will THEY (police) feel if someone drops their dad on the floor like that.  Let us stop protecting bad police offices. They should be accountable for any wrong doing just let every profession. I love America but seeing our police treating civilian like the way they did to that man makes me sick.
207,207,This is shameful and sad watching. I sympathize with Mr Patel who was violently taken down by police. It shouldn’t have happened. The best way is to try and calmly talk to him and interact with him. Outrageous move by these police officers.
208,208,"I was a police officer for many years and I am here to say that I am ashamed at these hoodilum police officers who have no respect for anyone including the elderly. I blame their training. In police school they are not given  enough training to deal with the elderly, to them everyone is a Perp, short for perpetrator."
209,209,Tough guy hurt old man...i was brought up old navajo tradition respect the old and help them and don't hurt them.. Take care of our elders.. Clear this officer has no compassion or respect.. He has a power trip..police are here to serve and protect us...MOST officer don't do that they hurt people...prayers to the old man for his recovery from this evil person.
210,210,I hope that the police officers in Madison learn to change their hearts when attempting to do there job that goes for anybody in a police uniform
211,211,"I am from India several time I have heard that Police of US is very very strict, eductated kind and constitutional but watching this video it feels that such type of police is dangerous than terrorist they are not human

US is said to be developed if the they are doing such type of activities what about developing countries"
212,212,A frail old man is a threat? And what's that about speaking a foreigners language? This is crazy
213,213,This why we need to be given the right to sue police unions and get rid of immunity!
214,214,"I can’t believe this! You break his neck! 

MMA show all of a sudden"
215,215,The cop has an IQ in the single digit.
216,216,"I feel for this man but this is happening in his state also (Gujarat) against his own fellow Indians ( Muslims, dalits ). So think of this good lesson to understand"
217,217,2:22 dude that's really gruesome
218,218,Few days ago I met a couple from uk .they were roaming at the streets. and I talked to them instead of calling cops
219,219,This would make it fair if the judge would allow him to have a MMA fighter take on the cops in a legal fight so the cops would learn a lesson.
220,220,"When you go to china, india, japan, korea, speak their language too"
221,221,"That argument is rediculous. Understanding and speaking the language is absolutely helpful but, using that in court to defend an officer that was absolutely, in the wrong........thats beyond disappointing to me......"
222,222,Oh what a tough guy. We are all so impressed by the brave officer taking down the aggressive knife wielding bad man.
223,223,Sue ALL involved and take their jobs the cops and the DA.
224,224,The police department need to compensate this man.
225,225,"Trust no cops 
You don't know the good ones  from the bad ones"
226,226,He clearly mentioned house 148 .... Shame of the police officer
227,227,"Poor man, such an unfortunate experience, just because he could not speak English...he needs to be compensated. And the police everywhere needs to understand that you need to do your duty but be wise  not to hurt others and result in hurting yourself."
228,228,So if you're a cop and somebody's walking down the street and there's no probable cause to question now. A jury feels you have the right to attempt to kill them because they don't comply with your commands. What the hell has happened to our country?
229,229,"When you come to the us we expect you to speak our language...
Right cos your tourists have great skills at speaking other languages"
230,230,We are all same no matter what colour we are in. Such a shame to see this
231,231,HOW DOES THAT RACIST NEIGHBOR FEEL?! I PRAY THE SAME HAPPEN TO THE NEIGHBORS AND THEIR FAMILY!
232,232,""" Walking while brown, not speaking English and elderly"". You spot a man in your neighborhood. He is frail. He is old, yet he merits a phone call to the police? Was the neighbor concern that he was lost? ""I do not speak English."" ""I am from India."" You (police) give him a command in English which he does not totally comply with and then you SLAM this frail, elderly man face down! I did not mean to hurt him? You are a pathetic cop (ex-cop, thank you, Lord). The persons who failed to see the need for this man to be convicted are also pathetic."
233,233,To this day when I see this video... i cry . I feel so bad for his son . I cannot imagine this thing happening to my parents . Will this happen to a white elderly ?!! No
234,234,"I'm not surprised when she said ""Alabama"". Lots of shit goes down there. But I hope he recovers asap ❤️"
235,235,"It's just sickening  some of the things these cops do to people. He literally slammed an old man for pulling his arm away. Power tripping. If you don't do exactly what I say because you don't understand what I'm saying, I will hurt you. I'm glad he was fired and charged."
236,236,"Just think that this situation was on video and clearly shows illegal actions by the police. If there wasn't a video, the cop would have gotten a medal for taking down this old man and saving the neighborhood. Where is Eric Parker now? How can he ever be a policeman again? They should make it public, the names of the people on the Jury too."
237,237,I’m so sad
238,238,"The guy was only in America for a week, didn't speak English, and was just going for a walk.  They could have just got a translator on the radio.  there was no need to toss a frail old man to ground."
239,239,Slamming an elderly man to the ground to protect officers?  What kind of cowardly cops are these?
240,240,Was always my dream to one day visit the USA...but by the way they appear to treat people of color.. might as well just stay where I am.
241,241,Humanity should be taught to these officers even before recruiting them to the police.
242,242,This is insane.
243,243,I am from. INDIA i just heard this...  And i am. Deeply angry for the police actions..
244,244,"That poor man. I hope he recovered at least most of his abilities.

The badge wearing thug who injured Mr Patel was tried twice in federal court but the jury could not reach a unanimous decision, so two mistrials, then state prosecutors decided they didn't have a good enough case to try him on third degree assault, and dropped their charges, so the thug got off free and clear from any criminal charges. That means he kept his badge and is probably still working as a police officer somewhere. Not that it's any surprise."
245,245,"How can the officer say he tried to get away from me, when he kicked the mans feet from under him and slammed him to the floor. How can it be looked at twice and the court says than can see the officer did nothing wrong."
246,246,This is why i REJECTED the chance for a onshore opportunity to USA for 3 years..I can eat avg live here ...i won't ever travel there..the discrimination is unreal...I m okay to live in a 3rd country WORLD
247,247,"What a gentle soul this guy seems to carry. If he kept saying 148 148 and pointing towards his house, you'd know he must be living there, and if you still pin him down like that, you were raised by racist parents. Karma will get that police officer beyond his legal punishment. The same goes for that racist neighbor. Amen!"
248,248,I wonder how many people were angered by this and I wonder if the ex-officer was adequately punished.
249,249,"News - "" Mr. Parker said he didnt intend to hurt Mr. Patel.""
Video - tosses violently Mr. Patel on ground."
250,250,"As an American, I am disgusted by the way this poor man was treated.  To think a man cannot take a walk through his own neighborhood without being brutalized. The officer was convicted of the assault, but that doesn't compensate Mr. Vaidyanathan for his horrific experience.  Most of the police in our country are good people.  But some are nothing short of evil."
251,251,HE NEEDS TO SUE!!!
252,252,"I went to Congo, i don't speak Congolese and Zairese but the people and the police were very kind and helpful. Clearly in the world there are people of the devil and people of God."
253,253,As a American I'm so sorry this happen to u. This is another reason why the cops r out of control.  And it's sad that another American thought this elderly man with suspicious for walking in he's neighborhood where he lives and they can't handle themselves with any kind of control is amazing. I hope ur father recover from this.  :-). I really hope the cop gets charge with assault.
254,254,"Cop: I didnt wanted to hurt him

Paralyzes him so that he doesn't feels pain 😆"
255,255,"Is it good I wish we do the same to every American who visit my country 💔 most heart breaking thing I seen 😢
Really Americans behave so bad to everyone"
256,256,"3:00 U.S. doesn't have official language, english is common language same as spanish, but it's not official US government language, and he didn't break any law... he was walking on a sidewalk, regardless if he live there or not that is not a crime, that is a public street... worst defence argument ever. even if its stop and identify state, reasonably articual suspicious needs to be preset for a stop. Being a suspicious person not a crime and that reason can not be used for a stop alone. That man, didn't climb a fence or walk to someone's property... he was walking around his house (property that he live in) as exercise."
257,257,"American went to the Philippine and couldn't speak Pilipino language, well pilipino will adjust. we the pilipino people treat foreigner like our own flesh and blood. we are all humans... follow the simple GOLDEN RULE. and you are be blessed, God is watching YOU!"
258,258,"This is why i like 🇬🇧 more then 🇺🇸, Police in UK can never do this to you."
259,259,"I agree that you must obey the laws and speak the language but why so much force and why try to hurt someone that’s non violent. Question the guy, search him then take him home. Where has the common sense gone? Stop hurting people just because you can!"
260,260,Pushed?? He was slammed
261,261,I see you for the cop and for the man as well. What happened was very unfortunate but as Asian who is living in Australia I can say if you're coming to come too late this you should know at least a little bit of English to save your bacon. Everyday Americans going through lot of terrorist threat so sometimes even police is violent. But seeing that an apology is required from the authority
262,262,"I’ve rewound this many times. There’s NO MOVEMENT from the old man b4 they slammed the poor guy. Not a flinch, a jerk, a pull, NOTHING!"
263,263,"So the policeman saw a need to quickly tackle some skinny old man, who wasnt threatening at all...
And why does ""speaking English"" need to be a requirement???... I want every other country to detain every American tourist who disrespects the law and culture of other countries."
264,264,"Eric Parker was subsequently allowed to return to work at the Madison Police Department, being cleared of any policy violation of the department. He was required to undergo re-certification."
265,265,"I don't understand how they couldn't come to a unanimous verdict the tape is clear as to what happened I think that race has played a lot in this decision, just hope it never happens to one of them, it would be a different story"
266,266,Imagine that cop ending in India unexpectedly....!!!!woahh
267,267,"History says that when people move from not so good places to better places , they are not liked by locals"
268,268,That cop was acquitted after multiple hung juries and returned to duty. Imagine if he was a cop in your town.
269,269,"It's his human rights that have been violated, something that have been going on for too damn LONG!"
270,270,My best understanding of why these incidents keep happening here in america is that since the 80s all cops are trained that their number one priority is their own safety so there is no reason not to physically  attack a suspect or shoot them just in case they might have had an opportunity to hurt the officer
271,271,"that man was there just to take care of his grand children and just think of the trauma he'll carry back to his home , will he want to come and visit his grand children that casually now?  
This is fucked up"
272,272,Poor man. The officer officer slammed him real hard. They could have just hand cuffed him and brought the house and checked.
273,273,"It helps to have the command of the language of the country you are residing in. I'm not being mean, but I've traveled too and it is very much a safety issue to know the language."
274,274,Ofcourse you should learn and adjust yourself accordingly to what country you choose to move to. But using excessive force doesn’t help the situation.
275,275,"To all the people in comment section I understand ur feelings, but doing the same thing back to Americans (as a revenge) is not a thing to go forward. We're better than them, if a foreigner comes to your country and if he doesn't know ur language try to help him and show love, because the 🌍 needs it now more than ever!"
276,276,The crazy thing is that I'm the same age as the officer and I know from my short life experience that older native Indians and older Asians ALWAYS WALK AROUND!
277,277,Protect other officers from a dangerous handcuffed pensioner.your police are a disgrace
278,278,"😐“911, there’s a black man walking down the street”.🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
279,279,"Indian parents don't visit kids in US often but when kids here are in need like taking care of grand kids or something they visit. Once here, it's different than India....clean air...quiet...lotsa places to walk n see to pass time."
280,280,Monster behaviour by US police
281,281,"It is December 2018, this case is still ongoing. A simple Google search shows that a local news channel in Huntsville reports that a Federal judge says Sureshbhai Patel’s excessive force claim against Eric Parker should be heard by a jury, and that Parker has appealed ruling. He is still being tried by federal authorities and no justice on behalf of Mr. Patel. This is a clear cut example of racism, civil rights violations and excessive force. The white woman who made the phone call probably has NO CLUE of the amount of stress, pain, legal drama she inflicted over her FEAR and SUSPICION.  She just wanted to ""FEEL SAFE"" in ""her"" neighborhood --- this is what comedian George Carlin was talking about in a stand-up comedy special when he criticized white Americans for the notion of ""the illusion of security"" (the stand up special is on YouTube)."
282,282,"There is no way that was a mistake. They took out their frustration on the poor old Indian guy. You can hear the dispatcher informing the cops that he doesn’t understand english so how can they expect him to understand their commands??? He clearly wasn’t any threat to the officers. After all this, the cop is freely roaming the streets. What a shame!"
283,283,Defense Attorney sought to blame victim for his own injury
284,284,How the hell does jury not reach a verdict?
285,285,"A 27 yea old policeman behaving in that manner.  Elder abuse with no understandable provocation.  Shameful.  What is taught at the academy?  It is clear the man posed no threat whatsoever, but his health was unnecessarily compromised by uniformed bullies.  These are the kind of men who should take responsbity for the current unrest.  Their behavior was indefensible. Police must understand the meaning of serve and protect and be made personally liable when their decisions are reckless and lacking in common sense and compassion.  Sorry for rambling, but can anyone justify that takedown?  Their defense was probably related to “tankard of behavior” which  are themselves exceedingly troubling."
286,286,that caller should also be held liable to this outrageous and inhumane act. and that police who slammed the old man's defense about coming to america should follow the law: yes but the way he demands english be spoken. i must say he discriminates. he is an arrogant person.
287,287,In US people are more threatened by police than criminals
288,288,"I wonder  what this  man family think about him after seeing this  evil done to an elderly man  who was  of no threat  to him at all ?. "" What goes around  comes around"" .  I'm  quite sure that  The person who made that call is also not  feeling  too  good   . Our conscience  is a hell of a thing I know...God installed it there for a reason . It's weight  is so heavy .....nothing  else hold you down more ."
289,289,I know this is an old story but if that cop had done that to my elderly father that cop would never walk again.
290,290,I saw the full original version of the interaction between police and the Indian Gent....the police themselves said twice he doesn't  understand or speak English then slammed him to the ground for not following their commands...Officer Parker should personally pay for this man's medical Bill's and charged with felony assault since he was in possession of a gun and serve time...SUCH A DISGRACE!  Makes me ashamed the way this man was treated...
291,291,"and it’s guys like this that make the whole
profession look bad…. shame on him"
292,292,Now you know what us black people go through day by day...
293,293,"Poor man, hope he will fully recover soon. This is really bad on how the cops treated this foreign man. In our country, Dutch police would never body slam somebody for not speaking Dutch. Even Indians are not save anymore. Another bad day to be have a darker complexion."
294,294,"We Indians are so forgiving, i feel so sad that i am about to cry, in India we respect our elders so much and never dare to in a million year put our hands on them. USA- the greatest country in the world smh😖."
295,295,The video shows it very clear. The guy wasn’t running away.
296,296,"There is absolutely no excuse for that kind of takedown of an elderly person. If they needed more information, the police should have arranged a translator to facilitate communication. That someone cannot speak English is no excuse to severely assault (and subsequently injure) them. This cop needs to be in jail."
297,297,Unbelievable the caller must not have anything to do if he calls and reports this  wow  Glad officer was arrested & charged.
298,298,Doesn't anybody realise that this is partly the caller's fault?
299,299,"Would it have been so hard for the police to just walk the short distance to the house where he lives, find an English-speaking relative to straighten everything out?"
300,300,"Eric Parker...see what he said when he threw the man to the ground? “Stop trying to get away from me”. I didn’t see the man try to get away,did you?"
301,301,"He was not "" pushed "" , he was Slammed to ground with Extreme Prejudice. May Ganesha be his guide to better health and blessings."
302,302,When he’s in America he should abide by the law..... which law did he exactly break by walking on streets? I though America was recovering feom racism but seems it still exists quite well there.
303,303,Love usa from india
304,304,"The point is, What is wrong that two jurys faild to convict?
Plainly the crime of ""going for a walk"" does not warrant the the assault on this inocent man."
305,305,"POC, a lot of law enforcement (and general public, because someone called the police. 🙄) view POC, regardless of how you look, as a criminal. Be aware of your rights, and record."
306,306,You have to speak their language? If not? Paralysis awaits?
307,307,"There was no reason to physically assaulting an old man who from no angle can pose any threat to the fully armed, trained young police officerS. The poor person was outnumbered, old and unable to understand the language. This only tells one thing - the police officer needs medical help and need it now until then - he remains an open threat to society."
308,308,This shit changed my mood.
309,309,Why do we have to speak English in USA even if we don’t come from there.It’s the stupiest thing I’d ever heard.
310,310,The force used to take down the harmless old man was completely unnecessary.
311,311,That neighbor should be held responsible
312,312,Its scary to live in usa
313,313,"Appreciated American government for following strict rules even to fellow American citizenship. If it's India, he must get beat n even will charge with a big money.. Whether u r hurt or not all the responsibility will bear by yourselves.. Great respect... My fellow indian, we still cannot compare with them, they r loyal to everyone.. Stop criticized them...."
314,314,How can they expect someone to learn the hardest language in a week? The American police are just brutal.
315,315,Policeman breaks 58 year old mans neck.....Blames the man. You literally couldn't make this up.
316,316,"""(I body slammed him harder than I would an animal but,) I didn't mean to hurt him."" It's a wonder his lips and tongue didn't fall off for telling that blatant lie! AND, the nosy neighbor who caused it all should be a party to any suit. It was, from her statement,  another case of walking while Black. I bet she was shocked to find out he actually was not!"
317,317,What the hell is wrong with these police!!!! This abuse is indefensible anywhere.  No wonder people distrust the police in the USA!
318,318,"He clearly said ""No English"" was that very hard to understand for English speaking officer."
319,319,"You should change your lawyer Eric. I'm not a lawyer but your lawyer's argument has no sense at all. From what I see, Mr Patel did mention that he doesn't speak English, second he's an old and skinny man he shows no agression, cooperated and he couldn't be a threat to you."
320,320,That they even blame a 50 kilogram grandpa for nearly being killed at the end. Those american lawyers life on a different planet.
321,321,"What to do when the law is in non truthful hands....

on January 13, 2016 U.S.District Judge Madeline Haikala granted an acquittal motion by the Alabama cop’s attorneys, ending the federal civil trial for Parker permanently. The prosecution filed a counter motion to not acquit Parker, but the judge dismissed the prosecutions’ motion, instead siding with the defense, saying the victim, committed a misdemeanor by leaving the house without identification."
322,322,Apparently officer saw a free  chance to practice some of the technics he learned in sumo wrestling class.
323,323,"I would sue the person who called the Police on his Father, cause if it's wasn't for them none of this mess is going to happened"
324,324,"Many go to the U.S. because they think it has a wonderful set of constitutional values which apply to everyone. 
Most Americans, the police included, don't give two figs about the constitution. They just live and operate in their own little bubble."
325,325,I saw no attempt to pull away or leave the scene. These police did this with intent and should be fired and jailed.
326,326,"""If you come to America you need to speak English""

Meanwhile
*School teaches their students how to speak Spanish 🤦"
327,327,"As an update, the cop was allowed to resume his job as a cop after he was cleared of any misdoings following a third trial by Jury which was composed of 8 white males and 2 black females. 8 white males gave him a verdict of not guilty and the 2 black females found him guilty."
328,328,as a pakistani i support him
329,329,That cop was afraid of a 90 pound unarmed skinny guy wtf if he faces a 200 pound armed person I think he will shit in his pants.
330,330,It’s a shame that anyone can call the cops on anyone for any reason and after stuff like this happens they don’t face any repercussions.
331,331,"3:01 speak our language!!! Well, there is no official language in the U.S.!!! BTW in Michigan, Arabic is the second most spoken language! Should I treat Americans badly because they can't comply with my orders?!!"
332,332,US cops should go back to the Academy and learn how to handle people well. Whats wrong with the coppers these days .??
333,333,"In India, homes always have an outer boundary wall that encloses the front yard and the backyard, hence clearly demarcating a property, while in the West the front yard (and backyard) is part of homeowners property but mostly it's not clearly demarcated. New arrivals to the West may not know this. They may mistakenly trespass into somebody's front yard or backyard thinking it's public property and may think only the constructed (walled) part is where the property-boundary begins. But anyway, the punishment for such an innocent mistake should not be partial paralysis."
334,334,"The policeman's response escalated the  situation .wholly inappropriate response.amped up cop,no wonder people continue to be dismayed by too much force being leveled .Officer displayed NO common sense.Clearly the elderly man memorized his house #. Go to the house and speak with son.there was no reason for this man to suffer"
335,335,"3:06 wait i wonder if anyone from Europe first moved to America spoke Native American's language when they moved from Europe.
Didn't think so. Then again, they probably pulled over a native and told him if you want to live in America we expect you to start follow our laws and start speaking English. - btw Not all Americans are bad people, im dating a white woman. But there are lot of racist people in this country just like there are in India too."
336,336,sounds like the jury needs thrown to the ground in the same manner to see if it was legal
337,337,"Eric Eric Eric you best pray our paths don’t cross, in this life or the next"
338,338,It is the price of living in the US
339,339,"when loved ones come to the USA, perhaps they should have some kind of an official card that states that they don't speak english. this card should have names and numbers of people in their family and friends that could speak to authorities on their behalf. the card should also list their home address."
340,340,So if you can't speak English or you don't know the US laws then you better not go to America for a holiday or this could happen to you......how ridiculous is that.
341,341,"Why should Mr Patel comply with the officer request, was he detained? Another Tyrant Officer for the list. Two bully officers and an old frail man and they did this in the name of their safety? This is despicable."
342,342,It is all about being a good or a bad man. Breaking an old guys neck shows what you are. And I mean to point only to the person who did it.
343,343,"It is very much important for your father to learn how to speak English! And is also very, very, very important for every single immigrant to assimilate into the country that they have been welcomed into! We encourage you to do this exactly! The racist people, from all corners of the globe, will take offense to those that do not accept the new Customs, language and, culture of their home that they have chosen to flee to and have adopted as well as being welcomed to! Those that do not assimilate become rooted in racism buy those that refuse to adopt their new culture and country, as well as those that see them not becoming assimilated and refusing to be like them and in some cases actually demanding that the host nation's citizen's become subservient to their religion/god. It is this ladder that abuse of the new host nation has/is taken to offence! Why wouldn't they be horrendously offended? Imagine going to Saudi Arabia and demanding that they forsake all that makes them who they are, accuse them of midemeanor's/crimes and sit back an. ... ...hello? We heard a sword slice through the air, followed by a thump..."
344,344,The defense attorney is blaming the old man !
345,345,Good job mates that'll teach to be Indian
346,346,So in India there are 27 different languages that are spoken .so what if we Indians tell the visitors you should know all the 27 languages or you will be denied entry .how will they feel .
347,347,"The cop whose duty is to protect and ensure harmony has nearly killed the old man. 

He should be fired, punished with a jail sentence and at least have his neck broken so that he understands what he has done to the old man. "
348,348,That was clearly excessive. And this problem isn't a racist problem as much as it is an abuse of power problem that occurs with police of all ethnic backgrounds in all communities.
349,349,"Illegal stop, illegal questions, illegal ID demand, assault and a cover up. What do US cops have to do to get charged?"
350,350,"Haha, ""officer safety"" seems to be the go-to for everything they do wrong now days, nothing about the safety for others. Damn 2015, why has this been hidden from me!?"
351,351,2:21 wtf why tho ? hes a fragile old man and you were scared of your safety ??
352,352,He was racce profiled because of his Brown skin color. I bet
353,353,"There are untold numbers of ppl who may know the language but are nonetheless unable to speak or communicate. Is it lawful to just break someone's neck, back, or leg? How would he like his father treated that way anywhere? Bullies In Blue."
354,354,American cops need protection from the public
355,355,"As a NE Indian residing in Delhi, I feel really really good and at the same time 😁. 
For the people crying in comment section-
'What goes around comes around? '
   -you guys still have the guts blaming others for being racist while yourself the no1 in this game.. "
356,356,"He is a real indian dharmic even after getting his back broken he is still not angry that truly reflects our culture of billions of years, when you come to India we will still treat you with hospitality not hostility, but when the same bbc come to India it blames sanatani"
357,357,"From Russia with love. I meant America with love. Where the cops here are no different from the thugs robbing the liquor store. Our fine thugs in blue,  blue lives matter(sarcasm)!"
358,358,1:03 He's a skinny Black Guy.. This is America 🇺🇸
359,359,I feel sorry for mr. Patel and  wish him  all the best .
360,360,That person who called 911 must be an Alien 👽 who had never seen a human before😱😱😱
361,361,"When the cop and his defense attorney's family go on vacation to another country and the foreign police asks them question in there native language, I guess it's ok for them to slam him, his family and kids to floor for not understanding. He should be put away for long time. I bet this is not his first time using excessive force."
362,362,after seeing this - I have a lot of respect for Democrats who make the loudest noise about racism
363,363,"American police doing great job .... Keep it up

Indian 😞... 🚷"
364,364,sue the cop personal and the police department separately $10.000.000 minimum.
365,365,OH YES  THE SAFETY OF THE COPS THAT WERE CARRYING GUNS.  SHAME ON THE NEIGHBORS THAT HAD TO KNOW ABOUT THE INDIAN FAMILY LIVING      ON THEIR STREET AND NEVER WELCOMED THEM OR WANTED TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES.  THEY COULD HAVE  FOUND OUT THE PARTICULARS AHEAD OF THIS REDICULOUS EVENT AND PROTECTED THAT SENIOR  THAT DAY.     GLAD MR ZEALOUS COP IS GONE.....
366,366,"I hope the cop gets prosecuted, he is a danger to the community.
Hope you have a full recovery sir.

Cheers from Dallas 🇺🇸"
367,367,"He went for a walk, and mean people call the 👮 and the mean bully police officer doesn't like his accent so he paralyses him.  Welcome to the USA !!!"
368,368,This should be used an educational video for Training Cops. Poor guy broke is neck for no reason.
369,369,I appreciate the constitution tho truly gr8👌
370,370,Apparently in Alabama being a cop calls for very little intelligence .
371,371,"If I were his son, those cops would be in hiding"
372,372,"Police: Do not pickup that handkerchief. 
59 yr old man: I need to pick it up before it gets dirty on the ground. 
Policeman: He wasn't following our instructions, had to take him down."
373,373,That's why I have zero respect for the US police and court. They are very harsh and strict on crimes committed by civilians yet they are too forgiving on crimes committed by law enforcement. Perhaps why did they fail to convict him is beyond me. It was a very obvious crime that does not even require scrupulous investigation. There's no doubt that juries have played favouritism. They are irresponsible for being partial and unfair. Why else would this happen?
374,374,"I can't think of any reason why a jury didn't find the cop guilty. Clear, cut and dry case. Video evidence. A case can't get any better or easier to prosecute. The prosecutor must not have shown up for trial.
Note: There is not ONE thing the cop did right or legally in this situation. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, not even stop the guy from walking and asking him questions. Cops just CAN NOT do that. They're only course of action should have been to stay back and watch the guy for a few minutes to see if he was breaking any laws. If not, what I would think they should do is just drive by the guy slowly and wave to him. He'd realize that there are police in the area and see him causing him to think before he committed a crime, IF that was his intention."
375,375,"when you come to america, we expect you to follow our laws and speak our language. laws, yes. language, no. the defense is a joke."
376,376,"Capital lawsuit, hold the officer PERSONALLY accountable. The police department, in this case, should be financially responsible for the medical bills for LIFE. Eric needs to tried a THIRD time and held guilty with a prison sentence with nothing less than attempted murder"
377,377,these dudes do this stuff just to  show how tough they are. real tough man real tough.
378,378,"Any American entering Canada must be able to speak canadian, aka ""sorry"". Let's be honest here, that's not going to happen."
379,379,"He was a harmless old man, doesn't deserve such harsh treatment."
380,380,"He was lucky... 
US police Shoot 8-12 time n Said Don’t Move Don’t Move"
381,381,Police brutalities everywhere is condemnable whether it is by Indian forces on Kashmiris or american police on Indians.
382,382,This legit made me cry
383,383,"I went to Thailand twice, plenty of people couldnt speak english but I found no problems. Using public transport talking (communication) with police etc...looks like going to the USA is out of the question though!! They might attack me for no reason!"
384,384,The man is from the same state as India's PM Narendra Modi who was formerly the Chief minister of that state which is like a governor in US. I wonder what Indian Embassy said. There are numerous Americans in India whose neck can now be legally broken by Indian officers and the same argument can be put forth.
385,385,"Holy Cow, Good Lord. Sad :( , This is"
386,386,"WOW!!! I wonder if that (definitely white) woman who made the call to the cops realised what she had just done? Not that she'd care though.... 

PS - I almost punched my TV when I saw those idiot cops tackle said ""skinny black man""... why is the cop not behind bars atleast???"
387,387,Hope he wins millions
388,388,"Just a reminder that citizens are legally allowed to resist an illegal arrest, even to the point of taking an arresting officers life."
389,389,How can a frail old man be a threat to someone
390,390,"Police officer Eric Parker, who is accused of injuring Patel, was fired from the Madison Police Department and charged with third-degree assault but was reinstated into the force in 2016."
391,391,"I am crying watching this, why"
392,392,"With that Language logic, do you know how many languages we have in India. Since you will not understand our 2000+ languages, imagine what your state of health will be."
393,393,I blame those who trained the officers. They need to train them to distinguish between a threatening and non-threatening situations...
394,394,"If YOU slammed a cop and broke his neck, and partially paralyzed him, would you just get charged with 3rd degree assault? I mean losing his job means nothing if he can just go somewhere's else and do the same job.
Or do you think your charge would be more excessive, and more sever than that?"
395,395,"It’s sad that the jury failed to convict this cop twice. Oh!!! Forgot, this is Alabama."
396,396,"The reality is that usa cops support their locals more than outsiders but here in india its opposite, if a foreigner reports some issue against an indian, they are very prompt to help them"
397,397,"I think those police officers should be removed from the job that are taking there frustrations out on public by shooting them or blocking them to the ground
I realise there is a big risk in this job but you need the police to work with the public 
A health check up on the police force is definetly needed too"
398,398,Take away the gun and the badge and one can almost smell the fear in their eyes.  Every dog has their day and surely this ex cop will surely have his
399,399,"As an American, I apologize to this man. This was absolutely unacceptable behavior by that monster! He wanted to hurt that man."
400,400,"Stop fighting with us and make indian race proud....
Our in-fighting has kept our ppl down for centuries.  
Good luck from Pak"
401,401,"When you hit the police gym 4am daily to slam a frail Appu to the ground. What a boss. Also, Alabama."
402,402,"Let's make speaking and understanding Hindi and all the regional languages a mandate for any American tourist before they come to India to ""find themselves"""
403,403,the problem lies first in some old habits: we like to stare at you -  insanely wonder on the streets  - stare at your belongings stare at your home and so on - so rightfully someone called the police  -   you then meet inevitable warlike US man in uniform - things happened the way they were designed to happen
404,404,"So according to the defense, a deaf and mute person will be treated like this in us and not on the bases of any crime he committed"
405,405,They should also revoke the license of the defense attorney for making those comments. That cop is a coward
406,406,US cops should know body language. why they can't Identify old-man and using more force on him
407,407,I lived in Ukraine for 6 years. I could speak some Russian and Ukrainian but the people and the police in Ukraine are really generous and welcoming towards the foreigners. I had the best 6 years of my life in Ukraine. I can’t imagine something like that in the USA.
408,408,"It's their protocol do so this so that the man doesn't turn into a fugitive.
But at the same time it's a little questionable."
409,409,Still this guy didn't got justice 👏
410,410,"People visit foreign countries all the time without knowing the language. The so-called police officer knew he'd done wrong because he looked up to see if he was on camera just after he slammed the old feller to the floor. Why was this necessary? I'm only 64 but have spinal problems that are not obvious as well as a heart condition that needs an ICD, I shudder to think what state I'd be in if that were done to me. I don't think my back would have survived such abuse."
411,411,"""Welcome to America!"" Mr. Patel"
412,412,How was the officer in danger when the grandpa was in handcuffs ? wtf
413,413,Why don't the cops go after the 911 callers for such petty issues. That's abuse of the system.
414,414,We need more Robot police.
415,415,What a evil man!
416,416,"I noticed that the officer's safety was at risk, this old man needed to be brought under control. The officer is clearly innocent."
417,417,That was the defense attorneys statement..wow.he didnt break and laws .He can speak any language he wants
418,418,You have to laugh when they call themselves the land of the free and home of the brave.
419,419,"No excuse for this behaviour against this fellow. Illegal search, excessive force, third degree assault. And, for the defense to claim that this newly arrived Hindi should ""speak our language, he's partly responsible"" is utter bullshit. Shame on this officer.
Best get well and please stay wishes to Mr. Patel, from a caring American."
420,420,Uncle Get Well Soon! I am Patel too! Jai Krishna.
421,421,The cops is extremely excessively aggressive . Very shocking.
422,422,That poor man was treated horrifically by tyrants....not speaking fluent English was no reason for him to be attacked !! I am appalled at the amount of US cops that are merely thugs getting away with crimes every day !
423,423,Living the American dream huh???☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️ Well good luck!!😉😉
424,424,At times American police officer have some angry issues and decide to pour it out on others.
425,425,"I usually support the police, but not on this one. That was messed up. Poor guy."
426,426,I was so excited for my America trip but now i am scared af
427,427,"The arrogance of that young cop is on another level. The man could've been his dad but he calls him ""bud"" when walking up. His parents must be ashamed for raising a tyrant."
428,428,"""We acted in the interests of officer safety"" rofl. An unarmed 58 year old man thrown to the ground because he was a threat to the safety of THREE armed and trained officers."
429,429,"It’s unbelievable he said that the man who could barely walk was trying to get away .
HE WILL PROVABLY GET A PROMOTION FOR HIS HEROIC ACT 
I CAN SEE THAT COMING 
So the person that saw him walk was he hurting you in any way ?"
430,430,"So in the end, the judge ruled that the victim committed “misdemeanour” by leaving his house without identification and Eric Parker was acquitted. The federal trials ended up with all the charges against Parker being dismissed, and eventually, Parker returned to work."
431,431,Sue the hell out of them!
432,432,Cop gets off on hung jury.  Classic.
433,433,The defense attorneys are blaming the victim of course
434,434,"In India we say ""atithi devo bhava"" which in translation to English mean  (guests are equivalent to God). Sad that usa can't even treat us like humans"
435,435,"i am glad i dont live in U S and& A . great success👍👍 , high five 🖐️!!!"
436,436,Woah Indian cops are saints when compared to these guys. No Indian cop touches unharmed calm person.
437,437,"Both the caller and cops should be sued for everything they have!!!. The cops , not the tax payers."
438,438,Just think what should we do to Americans when they dont speak Hindi 😈
439,439,Can the defense attorney speak any native American language after the statement he made he is just as much as an outsider as the Indian fella
440,440,police knew that he was not harmed but he treated that old man like a toy... N broke his neck like in wrestling....
441,441,And of course the punk cop was cleared of any wrongdoing and was allowed to return to his job. His attorney is a complete ass. He's despicable for even thinking of remotely blaming the totally innocent victim.
442,442,What about the cops tampering with evidence when they dusted the grass off him?
443,443,America the greatest country on earth.....sometimes
444,444,"Honestly, what do you expect from the worldly people of Alabama? The neighbor who called the cops on Mr. Patel thought that a senior East Indian man was a threat of some kind, and described him as black. It reeks of ignorance and racism. The lawyer who defended the police officer, was himself an officer before practicing law, and has represented several police officers from the same division as the defendant. I doubt there would be any collusion between the police and the courts in that area? The officer was actually ""fired"" from his job for the assault on Mr. Patel, but the jury couldn't come to a decision and the officer was acquitted,  twice. I wonder how many East Indian people were on the jury? The defense lawyer actually said that "" Mr. Patel was responsible for what happened to him, because he didn't speak english"". I've never heard anything more disgusting, racist, and dismissive in my friggin life. That cop slammed that old man to the ground so excessively hard, you can feel his neck cracking through the video. The police repeatedly admitted on video that Mr. Patel couldn't understand english, and never tried to understand the little bit of english Mr. Patel was saying to them. The whole thing is racist, and so was the jury. That old man wasn't guilty of anything accept having dark skin in Alabama."
445,445,Just for a man looking around to find his house you gonna call the cops omg I bet that was another white person no offense
446,446,"Why r there so may instances of people reporting 'suspicious' looking person walking by their house, do they just sit around watching and reporting people who walk by?"
447,447,"If you are dark skin, you are black regardless of your ethnicity! Which is different from being African American, African or Indian. They are black skinned Indians, brown skinned and fair skinned. As well as light, dark, fair skinned Africans. I don't understand why some Indians don't wanna be called black and some of them are darker than Africans. Remember we all came from Africa."
448,448,"Will you show the same kindness to German, Japanese and Italian or may be French visitors too ???"
449,449,sue the police of excessive force and damage of your neck.
450,450,If the other unit did not pull up we never would have saw that viewpoint. I'm ashamed that I share the same last name of this good for nothing officer. They need to make his case federal not leave it to the state to prosecute..
451,451,"It's so scary to watch these videos and the US cop's, They only know how to talk,I hope it's doesn't happen to the Cops Parents for them to understand."
452,452,I am glad that they fired this cop.
453,453,How come the jury couldnt agree on a verdict ?seemed clear cut to me guilty as hell.
454,454,"DID YOU SEE THE SCUMBAG POLICE SWEEP BOTH THE GUY'S LEGS WHILE TOSSING HIM FORWARD?  100% in every single way, abused and corrupt to the core! 1000% intentional. This is old but man, it still surprises me."
455,455,Waiting for Eric to travel to India when he will be old
456,456,"An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind. Generalizing all Americans same will be incorrect. There are corrupt people everywhere in the world, as a community we have to find those people and put behind bars. It's hard to see an old innocent father beaten for no reason, the guy should be punished by the law."
457,457,My god how can assult on elderly man who even don't know their language
458,458,The cop needs to be paralyzed as well since he feels no remorse
459,459,Way to go for neighborhood watch
460,460,Acquittal of that cop is a mockery of justice
461,461,"This stuff makes my blood boil and embarrasses me as an American. I would like to offer my condolences to Mr Patel, and to say that most of America isn't like that...but, it does happen far too often (once is too much, but that's par for living in some ""perfect, fantasy"" world, and it's surely nowhere near that). Money won't take back what has happened, but I hope you sue the sht out of those responsible."
462,462,"Lets just blindly assume that bringing that poor innocent poor down was an absolute step to be followed: why did he apply that much force when even he could've brought him down not by half, not by quarter but  by 1/8 as much of force he applied to him. It is a shame, we are humans, the police's primary duty is to protect their citizens. That policeman is an absolute racist or needs psychological help."
463,463,"Walk
Police:wait thats illegal"
464,464,"Welcome to America. Poor old man, it’s sad to see what happened."
465,465,"Very sad, Get Well Soon"
466,466,"WELL AS PAKISTANI 
IM SAD BECAUSE HOW CAN U CHARGE ON SOME ONE LIKE THAT 
3RD DEGREE ASSAULT BROS 
ON A GRAND FATHER  "
467,467,I'm entirely condemning what has happened but Handkerchief and betel nut fell down from his pocket .BBC didn't add 'betel nut' to the subtitles. Maybe the officer had never seen a betel nut before and thought it to be something suspicious.
468,468,It doesnt matter if he doesnt speak english his a human being
469,469,"""Officer safety"" made him push the old man to the ground. What exactly were the COP'S ""safety"" concerns? How was the COP'S ""safety"" compromised?

And, WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with those two juries?"
470,470,"This man was not ""pushed"" to the ground.  He was methodically and surprisingly 'slammed' to the ground for no apparently justifiable reason.  The only reason offered by the cop is ""Officer Safety,"" an excuse for excessively aggressive action which has become redundantly misused by police.  I personally have no problem with cops reaching beyond the boundaries of necessity when dealing with some troublesome, wise-ass punk, but this man did nothing to deserve what was done to him.  The cop was plainly out of line, which is why he was fired, and what he did is going to cost the taxpayers of that jurisdiction a hell of a lot of money."
471,471,Cop is guilty in my eyes
472,472,I live in Canada... We have old Indian guys walk all over the place... No one knows what they are doing or where they are going... But they pose no threat and cause no harm... It's just what they do...
473,473,"I know from personal experience that police in USA is extremely helpful. 
I needed assistance in directions while on my way to NY, crossing Washington, and they used their car to piolet me to the right road. It was amazing and all with a smile."
474,474,"Acts 21:31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
Acts 21:32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul."
475,475,"When the cop forced him to the ground. He immediately looked at the camera. And thought, 'I just done and fucked up'!"
476,476,"I was looking for this follow up👍
Jurys were bought or intimidated"
477,477,"Dont worry mr indian , karma will get him not today but in near future he will recieve x10 pain of what he gave you , and he would be guessing how did it happen and curse the lord.."
478,478,"Yeah because someone will learn fluent English after being in the states for one week, especially as an older gentleman"
479,479,Pushed to the ground is a gross understatement designed to make people think that an accident happened.
480,480,Also arrests the ignorant caller !!!!! Its healthy to waök
481,481,"Acts 21:31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
Acts 21:32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul."
482,482,"I’m sorry this happened to this elderly grandfather just going for a normal walk. I hate to say that this is what Black People go through in the US and why we fight against this. Some people are not to supposed to be cops. And this is a perfect example of that. No use of human decency, common sense and compassion. There are some good cops but this was not one of them. He could have called a Sergeant into the scene especially since the gentleman didn’t speak English. Of lot of wrong decisions made on that arrest. And I have family and close friends who are officers."
483,483,does anyone have the instagram or facebook of this officer? i want to msg all of his friends
484,484,"Another example of 2 racist cops. One of them was Eric Parker. 
From Wikipedia : ""Police officer Eric Parker, who is accused of injuring Patel, was fired from the Madison Police Department and charged with third-degree assault was again reinstated into the force in 2016. In March 2015, Parker was charged by the FBI with felony civil rights abuse, but was later acquitted of all charges"""
485,485,What the hell the police did to the weak old man 😡
486,486,"Refuse to comply?

He doesn’t understand so how can he"
487,487,"Prerequisites and training to become a cop is pathetic. Anyone can become a cop. I remember the kids that were unintelligent in the classroom and benchplayers on school sports teams became cops. Not the sharp, cognitive, athletic individuals America needs to maintain order in our great civilization."
488,488,"Hopefully this doesn't change the minds of the general public to retaliate against all police officer, the actions of a few do not dictate the actions of all"
489,489,Thank God he is alive ...Back home police brutaliry is so common that even women and children are not spared
490,490,I didn't see a reason the officer had to do such a hard take down of the elderly man. Justice would be to fire this punk officer and pay #or this man's doctor bills and pain and suffering.
491,491,Who is watching this after cold-blooded murder of George Floyd ?
492,492,"It was racist.
I wish there was a mma fighter instead of a 54yr old man."
493,493,"One thing they all have in common they really think they are the good guys, put a fool in a costume give it a shiny badge and with the state 100% behind these automatons; this is the result but ultimately the real villains are me and you for allowing this, ah well at least death is certain that greatest of escapes."
494,494,"I believe the jurists who are holding up the guilty verdict should be slammed headfirst into concrete. If they can't get a guilty verdict out of this, the headfirst slam won't hurt the scumbags."
495,495,"America is used as an example of free country. 
""A country where you can't walk freely and breathe freely""."
496,496,This is soo cruel and inhumane. ...and the fact that he wasn't found guilty. .....there is a point of different communities stay together to avoid this type of shit to be honest. .it's like they called the same neighbours who called the police on the poor man to be jurors. ..
497,497,All I have to say is ( you reap what you sow)
498,498,How Indians show hospitality to foreigners.... And how they show us
499,499,"Indians contribute so much to America. I work with a lot of Indians, some first generation some second generation immigrants, they are all extremely smart, dedicated and kind. Also their weddings are crazy fun. America's police force should show pride in its ability to work with people from many cultures. Some police clearly lack it."
500,500,That policeman should get back to school and learn how to respect a senior citizen..Thats ridiculous..
501,501,"I have seen so many videos where some people are bothered by others for no reason. Why so arrogant? Why so cruel? These are the roads of destruction and people with this kind of behavior don't get it. By the time they do, it's too late when they will be sobbing and saying ""I am a good person. I never meant to harm anyone"". Well you are a bad person and you proved it so efficiently. Then you pretend to be nice which just makes you look like a fool. What influences these kinda behavior? I hate it every time I see a gesture like ""Oh your presence is so uncomfortable. I am gonna piss you off and deliberately put you in trouble despite you did nothing to me"". The world doesn't make sense any longer."
502,502,"I'm starting to think that Cyrus dream in ""The warriors"" was not so bad"

WHY SHOULD THEIR ACT OF TERROR BE PAID BY TAXPAYERS"
504,504,"cops need to be taught not to handle elderly people so roughly. at a certain age, falling down can be deadly. these guys knew that, they have elderly people in their family that they would never handle so severely."
505,505,This behavior really does need to stop...
506,506,Identify the damn callers. Sick of this.
507,507,I'd be okay if Alabama was no longer part of the US. We can now add Washington DC as a state keep the same number Stars
508,508,I apologize to the entire Patel family on behalf of the stupidity and ignorance of the that Alabama police officer who has to face justice no matter what the claim or excuse was. I'm black American and understand how it feels to be brutalized and treated like wild animals because of wrongful judgement of people based on circumstances beyond our own design. Please let there be no ill mindset towards all Americans based on this unfortunate outcome. Thank you and God bless.
509,509,We need to have blacklist for all the cops that assault like that.
510,510,Attorney Robert Tuten better be careful if he travels overseas...  no walking down sidewalks for him.
511,511,"Disgusting that white man should pick someone his own size, it makes me furious to see this old man in this condition for doing absolutely nothing. And the person who called was equally responsible"
512,512,"Shame on the cops .
Is it mandatory for foreigners to learn the country's language?
If so where's the democracy in it."

515,515,"America is scary ..don't know what to say ...no respect for elders

Shiver me"
516,516,What kind of police force would brake someones neck because of a language barrier?
517,517,A black skinny old guy is normally walking on the road. Immediately take action. ???
518,518,WTF With the jury.!!
519,519,the caller is the  culprit. Warn all policemen in the USA before anymore such incident happens.
520,520,"So if you go to Germany, you should be able to speak in German or risk being arrested???? Stop giving idiots power"
521,521,I hear so much about unnecessary gun violence in US where innocent people are being killed so I am just bothered why no one has beat the crap out of this cop and sent him to the hospital (or shot this officer and atleast the violence will be justified this time) to suffer the what the poor old elderly man suffered.
522,522,The policeman should be ashamed to com it an offence on this frail man. This is an evil thing to do to another person. Mr. Patel cannot defend himself. God has the last say in this matter.
523,523,What a shame cop or a coward showing his strength on a 58 yr old unarmed person.
524,524,Wow did that police even use his common sense when he slammed the poor old man to the ground ? Even so he has made himself clear he speaks no English .
525,525,"They police cripple people 
Like no big deal 
Thats unreal for doing absolutely nothing"
526,526,Crazy cop..I glad Mr Patel escaped being shot or something? I am an Indian in Canada.:(:(:(
527,527,What rubbish that he didn’t fallow ! Pollice here is so mean that poor Patel uncle had stopped answered and young police officers decided to show his skill on un armed old men.
528,528,"Alabama is the Gujarat of the USA and the capital of racism, Back in their villages in Gujarat upper caste people beat up lower caste people on regular basis, and not one is arrested or prosecuted. In Gujarati villages they wont let lower caste kids in normal schools or draw water from village well. What has happened to this man is sad, but a comparison in reality may help reduce the passions."
529,529,The cops and the neighbor that called the police need to be sue/jailed. This man would not be suffering if were not for these racist neighbors. Hope he recovers 100%.
530,530,This is an outrage!!! The force the cop used on the grandfather was just horrendous!!! Disgusted by the police man! Disgusted by his attorney's response that if you come to America you need to learn our language. He was only living in the State for a week!!! The cop should loose his badge too. No more law enforcement in his future. Sometimes some people disgust me. The neighbor who called the cops should be feeling really bad and apologize as well. They had a hand in this horrendous situation!
531,531,"For the person who said we expect you to know English if you come to the USA, you don’t need to know English if you don’t live there and you don’t need to know English to live life so he isn’t responsible."
532,532,Am not going to USA now. I prefer staying in my country. And trying to develop it
533,533,"I didn't knew in America hanker chief works as an assault rifle and illegal there . 

What about the hanky smugglers in the cloths shop do they get arrested too"
534,534,"Parker claims he didn't mean to hurt Mr Patel?  Then WTF was Parker thinking when he attacked Mr Patel with such force?
2 burly coppers versus one confused (not white) elderly gentleman? Not a good combination. Not a good outcome."
535,535,"I swear to god if that was my Grandpa, I'm catching a body or neck nocap"
536,536,"Honestly the man's son was quite a bit at fault here for not explaining the rules to his dad. He should have given him some ID, a phone number to call in case of an emergency and taught him some basic phrases to say in case he gets stopped by police. He left his dad out in a foreign country, when he has no knowledge of the language, no means to communicate... This was bad planning. Cops didn't need to be so heavy handed but the son was majorly at fault."
537,537,Intolerance and cruelty. Common attributes we see by officers around the nation.
538,538,Lock Parker up. The man did nothing.
539,539,"So the hunky  young police officer felt intimidated when faced against a frail old man, and used brute force just because he couldn't answer him properly? Who's the frail one here huh?"
540,540,So if any American comes to India and can't speak hindi should we do the same thing?
541,541,The cops mugshot shows he would make a perfect nazu role in a WWII film…
542,542,"His son is totally responsible for this, he should have at least cautioned him about the protocols which dumbass polove follows in US, he could have given him a phone to make calls."
543,543,"""REQUEST""? Illegal orders he means."
544,544,I hope that the police that hurt him pay for his injuries from their bank accounts.
545,545,"In Paris a lots of Americans but they all necks is right, even the don't speak French.... 😕"
546,546,Bloody stupid recruitment process led to this
547,547,If a cop in my country did that to someone's father or grandfather and isn't locked up... he's a walking dead man.
548,548,"This is why immediate execution in the public square of those officers caught doing crap like this should be mandatory.  Once it hits the court system, an officer will not be found guilty of his crimes so we need to bypass this option for them.  They broke their oath that they swore to uphold the constitution and that's enough.  They need to be held to a higher standard than ordinary citizens but they seem to have a ""Get out of Jail Free"" card instead."
549,549,😔😔
550,550,"White people, white people. I remember this incident because it was on the news for a short while but the online news kept me up-to-date. If you're of color in America and a white person feels that you shouldn't be in their ""white space"", these things will continue to happen. This man was a healthy individual going for a walk. My grandmother is a black woman who speaks no English, only Spanish a little Portuguese, and I imagined this could have happened to her within my majority white neighborhood. This is disgusting and upsetting. What do you think happened to the officer who literally used excessive force, shoot I would have thrown in some hate crime charges as well if I were the DA."
551,551,"They didn't even have the right to search him. I hope he won a civil suite, please tell me he sued. I hope the training officer is proud of his student."
552,552,Why on earth does anyone want to move to the states. And stay there?
553,553,"While this is indeed a horrendous use of force, any foreign visitor to the US who does not speak English should carry a note stating where they stay, phone numbers of close relatives and a photo copy of their identification."
554,554,Truly the American dream is a great one.
555,555,How dare the police man do this .. ashamed of us police ..
556,556,This man being injured for no reason at all is quite bad.  Let's remember that most cops WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS  !!!!   AT ALL !!!!!    I cannot believe or understand the lack of brains by so many people.  God help us.
557,557,Welcome to the USA. Where taking a walk may get your neck broken.
558,558,"Oh no I don't know the Arabic like guy walking on street 

Must call the police !!!"
559,559,"How many monolingual English speaking Americans travel abroad to countries that do not speak English and are treated with dignity and respect? None of these countries say if you can’t speak our language do not visit us. The use of the language barrier as an excuse for barbaric behaviour on the part of the policeman is the height of hypocrisy, no doubt."
560,560,He should thank USA he wasn't shot 20 times and teased million volts
561,561,The troubles these police officers have to go through is not their fault. It’s just how much this country has gone through like 9/11 since that time USA has toughen there law like using force every time they see a little bit of trouble. Also being a police officer is a really hard job but its even harder for American cops because of what they and there service men go through everyday. Before they go out to the field they always think this could be there last day and this could be the day they die and because of that fear there reaction of a little trouble always turn into using force to protect themselves and others. But remember one thing because of these officers people still live from horrific days that happened in America and I’m not trying to say that the military men and women are nothing all saying is that please give them respect and respect what dangers they go through everyday just so u could have a great sleep in your bed. Than you.
562,562,"Robert Tuten, when anyone goes on vacation people in other countries don't expect the tourist to speak their language. That is what we call hospitable countries. What country you're in?"
563,563,The man's age and congenial disposition   should have been enough warning to these blood thirsty cops.
564,564,Shameful defense attorney. He held the old guy equally responsible. He was not at all restraining. If police officers like them are not controlled then nothing will improve. what is wrong should at least be acknowledged.
565,565,"Follow laws yes, but what law was this elder man breaking. Not speaking English?🤔"
566,566,"These are what the US flag 🇺🇸 color stand for:
Blue: freedom
Red: liberty 
Green: humanity"
567,567,"Why did the cops treat him this way. He wasn't doing anything wrong, he was just walking. Wow what a criminal, cops where in fear of his life!"
568,568,i hate how westerners are greatly accepted in asian countries while asians in western countries get treated like this (not all but most)
569,569,"""refused to comply with officers request""?   ""acted in defense of officer safety""?   


what a pos.  now he tries to come up with excuses for his violent actions.  I love our police officers but the two that did this to this man are scum."
570,570,"Victim said ""he thinks that what the officer did was wrong but doesn't feel angry."" Welcome to Hindu advaita vedanta teachings. Only if everyone on this planet thought and felt this way."
571,571,"""If you come to my country speak our language"""
572,572,"Basically....
American Police: Hello there, what are you doing here?
Asian: Walking around (In Broken English)
Police: Well... Can you speak English?"
573,573,"Then when Americans come to India we accept them to follow our laws and speak Hindi, tamil, sanskrit, punjabi, Assamese, bengali and all the other hundreds of languages in our country."
574,574,"There is some innate problem with american defence departments, that everytime they are in the wrong side of things(come on dont try to defend them if they are always found on the wrong end) and that defence is asking for every person coming into america to be able to speak english??
Like if that would be the case over here, every american visiting India will be facing severe injuries on each visit considering we have a ton of languages and various dialects that change every 50km you move ."
575,575,This is so infuriating
576,576,"Oh sure, because all Americans become fluent speakers of every non-English speaking country they visit!! Hope this man gets compensation!!"
577,577,Since when has been illegal not to speak english in the USA?
578,578,"He is an old guy from India who does not speak english, why would you even think he is a threat to officers? Cop should rott in prison"
579,579,This is America. Where respect is earned by the looks not by the humor
580,580,"He is speaking gujarati, and guess what im from gujarat as well"
581,581,The defense lawyers comments sounded like a racist person would say to a person of color about not speaking English. Also the other comment about following the laws what laws did this grandfather broke? I guess this defense lawyers thinks not speaking English is a crime.
582,582,"As an Indian after seeing this other racism videos now I know why India is the best in the world.After learning all these things now it's high time that we Indians shouldn't go to UK,US and other foreign countries to make them great. Instead be in India and make it great again."
583,583,Dude that US physical cop just lost the plot
584,584,Things aren’t always what they seem . If you watch the unedited footage without any commentary you will see a different picture. Yes the cop could have handled it different but the guy is also to be blamed for not speaking a word of English not carrying an ID for not being complaint . He was trying to ignore the commands tried to walk away & resist as well . You can hear the cop saying “ stop trying to jerk away from me I will throw you to the ground “
585,585,I say because there were other cops involved or and witnessed  that cop assaulted that man and did nothing to the cop. This gentleman didn't brake a single law but the cops did so what's the moral of this. Cops can break the law just ask my 11 year old granddaughter and she'll tell you cops are bad.
586,586,"this is something ben shapiro would say:""youre afraid of 5.7 skinny indian grandfather"""
587,587,I feel sorry for all Americans that they have to live in a country like this. My faith in humanity just took a tumble after watching this video. Absolutely shocked and saddened. It should not happen to any human being anywhere in the world!! Absolutely shocking!!
588,588,"Police are trained to obtain ID at pretty much all means necessary. He wasn't suspected or committing a crime. I guess the cop could of said we're detaining you, but it wouldn't have mattered he couldn't understand him. Whats wrong with just letting him go? Is there anything wrong with that? You had no charges against him. Is that against policy? Getting a conviction on the cop is going to be hard. He wasn't complying, he didn't speak English, and keep trying to walk away. After 2 mistrials they'll probably drop the charges."
589,589,"""PUSHED"" He was slammed head first to the ground!!!!!"
590,590,The Policemen should be sued to no end for PARALYZING a poor grandfather...
591,591,The lesson is if you come to America keep in mind the police lives are more important than the innocent civilians.
592,592,27 languages in India....my language is one of them...can u speak my language?AO(naga)???
593,593,a lot of americans come to india and get to know the culture. we respect them and treat them with dignity. its because we are mature in out way of thinking unlike immature racist kids in america. yall need to grow up.
594,594,"Honestly my opinion on this matter is that the cop was 27 years old so that means he probably just started his career,so maybe he thought of showing off by claiming he handled the situation so good by doing some stunts...I guess that's the reason"
595,595,"I dont even know which one is more dangerous anymore, a thief or a citizen"
596,596,"Are the people who are so attached to this idea that you have to speak English if you come to this country forgetting about tourists? And they, themselves being tourists in other countries? If we go to Sweden tomorrow will it be justified if  something like this happens to us because we couldn’t speak Swedish?"
597,597,Such brave officers!! They received training for bringing down old men lmao.
598,598,"Does every police officers know sign language? Probably not! If your argument is for ppl to know English if you come here in the US, is a dumb argument! Ppl can communicate even if they speak diff language if and only if they take their time to interpret and try to understand. What this cop did is a no empathy act, specially to a much and harmless old man!"
599,599,"It is a travesty (though no surprise) that cop, Eric Parker, was not convicted.  It's a surprise a misbehaving cop was charged and prosecuted at all.  Though Parker may not have intended physical injury, he was unnecessarily aggressive and there was no legitimate reason to impose physical force on this innocent, inoffensive man.  He is responsible for the injury he caused.  The defense attorney's attempt to project blame on the victim through his statement that visitors to the U.S. are expected to ""obey our laws and speak our language"" was wrong on both counts and reflects not only his own attitude but widespread ignorance, arrogance, bigotry and xenophobia among our population.  That little, old man was clearly not violating any laws and there is no requirement either to speak or understand English in the U.S.  This is only one of a multitude of unpunished outrages committed by police officers in the U.S.  The ""bad apples"" among police are, and have always been, common and give the public ample cause to mistrust police.  Now we have cameras and video and bad cops are sometimes held to account, but not nearly often enough.  Kudos to these Alabama prosecutors for bringing this case to trial twice.  It's a shame they weren't successful in securing a conviction."
600,600,t h i s   i s   a m e r i c a   ...
601,601,"Everyone is saying they broke his neck because of the language barrier, but to be fair it does look like he tried to get away. He did use way to much force, but he might have been fed up with the guy and his emotions got to him."
602,602,"Disappointed is not enough, Disgusted is how TRUE American Patriots feel about this gratuitous Excessive use of Force."
603,603,U know how justice can be served for this by breaking necks of those pigs 🐽 in same way that would be a justice. U gotta take justice on your own ain’t no body giving it to u
604,604,He didn’t mean to hurt Patel. He meant to kill him.
605,605,What a crock... As if officers can do as they please.City should share responsibility old man was harming no one and police do this??  Dan
606,606,And where he ends up in Alabama wow if I were u I would get out of there as fast as I could
607,607,What the officers did was extremely bad. Could not care less that he could not understand them. They need way more done to them than what has already happened.    Now for Robert Tuten Defence Lawyer needs to be sanctured   due to his statement about it was also Mr Patel was also at fault. Well Robert Tuten could you speak and understand everything within 1 week of being BORN.  He should never be allowed to be a lawyer any more.
608,608,Caller Karen described skinny and black. The person is brown not black. Good job Karen!
609,609,Why did they body slam an old man and  for what reason.
610,610,This is so sad to see that Police in America basically does the same thing that taliban does in Afghanistan.
611,611,"some of those who run forces,  are the same that burn crosses."
612,612,You can't even walk down the side walk anymore?
613,613,"America is a total disgrace in welcoming foreigners , still balling with racism.Secondly It is  disgusting that officers like that are actually recruited to be front line workers. They need to be mentally checked and analyzed for their ability to maintain stability and patience working in a job like that. This video just shows the officers lack of mental health. I do hope that the man recovers 100%. To the officer what goes around comes around."
614,614,This attorney should learn that America has no federal language. Hindi is equal to English in the US.
615,615,That's a hard 58
616,616,"Meanwhile, in India we treat guests or outsiders as God and serve them"
617,617,No excuses !!!
618,618,UPDATE HE WAS ACQUITTED AND RETURNED TO DUTY
619,619,Trump approves of this policeman's  actions.
620,620,And what law did he break?
621,621,"It's not fair for us Indians to call out Americans for this incident. For all we see from the news, Americans themselves are also suffering from their militarized and out of control police. I'd be very nervous and scared around a cop in US."
622,622,Mr. Patel is an innocent and nice old man . He is not like one of those bloody jihaadis who shoot people not from their religion or behead men women and children . When officer Parker comes across one of the jihaadi types then only will he learn to appreciate people like Mr. Patel bhai . Shame on Officer Parker !!
623,623,"Pppfff they broke the life of another for nothing ! It's inacceptable !!
The young officer have a look very proud... For me he need to go a time in jail he can see how his life become break really..."
624,624,NWA shall make a song
625,625,Didn't mean to hurt Mr Pattel the police must have known he couldn't speak English hope he makes a full recovery.
626,626,Million of USA tourist come India 🇮🇳 and they break many law of India but police excuse them and doing nothing. People of India always ignore if foreigners doing wrong.
627,627,"Don't worry America, Indians aren't sad about his injury. They're happy because most of the people in India cannot afford to go to USA."
628,628,"This might be crazy thing , because American cops do their job when a suspect seems to be doubting, they grab him to ground to check either they have weapons or not , but in this situation I wish that cop would just lock him by saying put ur hands back , and take him to station and later grabs his phone or what ever he made had his pocket or anything and could inform to his son, poor officer he was so young in that police job . Hope the grand old man , police office be getting back soon together and forgive each other ."
629,629,And the neighbor who called on your dad should be brought up on charges for doing that crap on top of the police officer being fired and prosecuted
630,630,God bless anyone who is not white and rich in America.
631,631,Land of the prisoners Home of the cowards!
632,632,"So...if you come to India,we 3xpect you to speak in hindi...yes?"
633,633,Besides racism by the cops why do these American white  people not have respect for the elderly. Every other culture in the world has imense respect for older people. Am in tears watching these strong young men mishandle an old harmless man like this...
634,634,Now everyone knows what the original Americans go through. Which everyone calls so called black guys which we are the first and original people of America.
635,635,Defund The Police !!!!!
636,636,I agree with the Jury. There is justice in America. Mr Patel should've acted with some common sense. Will Mr Patel's son be sane and Saint if he finds cow meat in the fridge of his Christian neighbour back in Gujarat???
637,637,"It's Alabama, what else do you expect?"
638,638,"Let the Americans come to India, they will pay for this. As simple as that. And I will also like to say this to my fellow Indians, you can live a very happy life here in India. Being among your own people will feel more homely than staying with foreigners. Home is where your ancestry belongs and you won't find another home in this whole wide world. Today's India is not the India of 1947. India has progressed way further."
639,639,I bet u Mr Roberts to come to Malaysia and speak either 3 language malay chine or tamil otherwise I will make u paralaze
640,640,OK so if we any US citizen come to India and he is unable to speak our native tongue Hindi...then we have a Right to break his neck??? let me get hold of an US citizen next time...payback...!!
641,641,Defund The Police !!!!!

643,643,This uncle was lucky enough to be sponsored for visa as a dependant...imagine his plight if he attended an interview for a student or a work permit VISA......LOL
644,644,"Jb ye saale gore us se india aaye to hamari police ko bhi inke sath aisa hi bartao krne ka mangta. Unhe bhi hindi, tamil, teleugu, kannada, malyali, bangla, gujrati, marathi, etc language aana chahiye. Wrna hamari police bhi inki neck, leg, hand sb tor dena chahiye....US has become  One the worst country to live or to go for holidays."
645,645,"He wasn't pushed to the ground, he was slammed to the ground. Please get your facts right."

651,651,Even five years ago there were translation sites and apps that could have afforded this.
652,652,What did the jury not see . It was obvious what the cops did to him .
653,653,Welcome to America.....I guess its not the land of gold honey..lol
654,654,Various mistrials and all charged dropped against the cop. Judge threw it out saying he shouldve had his id on him.
655,655,And this day's no one is walking on the everyone have their own car now I know why if you'd be walking alone the cops  put your face on the ground maybe could kill you 😂 remember always have a car or don't walk what was a friend or your grandma 😂😋
656,656,"maybe police officer thought he was a black

664,664,I bet you a police officer it wouldn't feel the same as it was his father who was thrown to the floor by another police officer can't walk anymore this happens a lot people should not have to put on the floor to be handcuffed to ask a question to if you live there or not
665,665,India has 29 states with 3 different regional languages each.
666,666,Why did they hurt that man for no reason ?

680,680,"What? This is profiling! He is not black, also it’s against your rights for a police officer to go into someone’s pockets!He’s from Gujarat and speaks Gujarati!! Which is one of the top 15 language spoke in the USA not to mention. English isn’t even the official language of the USA, USA is one of the most multilingual nations with more than 500 languages spoken, he isn’t expected to speak any language the ask him to! These bozos in uniform need to educate themselves before they get theirs smh"
681,681,Defund The Police !!!!!
682,682,That policeman should be given equal punishment for showing heroism on an old man.
683,683,When Americans come to England it would help if they spoke English

685,685,American Thanks from bottom of my heart good news 😂😂😂😂😂

689,689,Pigssss!!
690,690,😱😱😱😱😱😱
691,691,Third degree assault is a kind charge.
692,692,What is the progress in the case. Can i know the citation of the same case.
693,693,"it is really inconceivable to voluntarily hurt an elderly person who is also handcuffed!  it's disgusting, he's not a cop, he's a monster, a criminal who uses the law to hurt people. 
I hope he will go in jail and pay for his crime
he should nerver work as a cop."
694,694,Imagine if it was a gang members's dad!
695,695,"Theres no official language in the US so when you say ""we expect you to speak our language"" that's kinda dumb since this country is built on immigrants and has not established an official language."
696,696,I was thinking to go to the usa for higher studies.... But now after watching this (and being an Indian) i fear my safety there...
697,697,How much compensation did he get $$$$ 😐
698,698,good..i pay more to you US guys good work..bring them to reality from billiwood...

700,700,Eric Parker I hope you reap what u sowed!!
701,701,I am a patel and this story makes me upset and sad 😢
702,702,"That cop was coward.   Him getting fired was great to see.  I doubt he could arrest a full grown adult man on his own anyway, so he was a useless cop to begin with."
703,703,Make sure the people that are making the phone calls are punished as well
704,704,He was not pushed he was slammed to the ground
705,705,"Breaking some1 neck for not knowing English, I think that's too much"
706,706,"This was by all evidence racially motivated. That is text book example of ""excessive force"" esp by a young aggressive and violent cop against an elderly and confused foreigner. The victim""s family should sue the police department and have this abusive, racist and violent cop fired and jailed."
707,707,"""Protect and Serve"".......no no no more like Kill and Destroy, that sounds about right."
708,708,Body slammed and crippled for not obeying orders from a cop who had acnowledged that he knew the man didnt speak english.
709,709,So sad
710,710,If that was my dad i find out who the fuck call 911 and if that cop would beat those charges he would be looking over his shoulder all his life...
711,711,The greatest country 🤣🤣🤣
712,712,"What I want to know is why this cop doesn't have to serve time for this crime, if it was a civilian they would be beaten and thrown in jail. And beaten more!"
713,713,"From now on all the American should face the same music in India, police officers of every states should talk to them in local language.
And give them no assistance until and unless they speak the local language."
714,714,You know when i saw a teenager i always dreamt going america...but after growing up anf realising the true face of America....i dont even what my kids growing up their because i cant guarantee their safety.if the police can do this to a 50 year old man...then imagine what they would do to a middle age black man
715,715,MAN I WISH I HAD BRIGHTBURN POWERS.
716,716,I live in a town with several generations of Indian immigrants. They customarily walk the neighborhoods in the morning and evenings. They are good neighbors.
717,717,"It takes some nerves to throw a skinny old man onto a concrete pavement. I wonder how they train cops in America. No wonder their own people hate them. And also, how come the court didn't punish him?"
718,718,"He hnew how to say ""my house 148"". What was the reason for the force?  Strip his bagde right off ,and give it someone with some humanity."
719,719,"Scared from an elderly person?Learn from Americans on how to handle them.Works Great, trust me, I have seen a footage."
720,720,There is no point in doing so ... His old barely even walk properly and then they hurt him
721,721,Sue the hell out of them .
722,722,Our language? Since when did the US have an official language.
723,723,U should sue the state county police force and the cops who did the crime. Go civil if these criminal courts keep protecting them
724,724,In every organization enemy will not come from outside
725,725,Who was the neighbor that called 911 on him they called a gun and a bully to this elderly man. All need to be sued Federally.. this cop needs a beat down for citizen safety. In my opinion.
726,726,American learn at least 30 language when you come to India.....we do have a brutal police force
727,727,"The officers who have done this kind act should come to india as tourist !
We will also treat you very well my friend
( worse than , u can even imagine )"
728,728,"You are more likely to lose you're life in america,than a traffic accident,especially if you are black.you can hear the officer trying to justify the way this man was being brutalized to his radio.looking for way out,"
729,729,For the safety of officer
730,730,Truly the land of the free....
731,731,"in usa everything is abnormal.
strange country strange laws"
732,732,Elder abuse! Where's EPS?
733,733,This very sad I feel bad for this indian father/grandfather people seeking a better life and are good people deserve a good life.
734,734,"the cops i believe were clearly acting blind. couldn't they tell that the man is elderly and harmless by looking at him. they did this to him just because of his colour, his look and that he didn't speak english."
735,735,"Officer safety my arse 
Brutally yes i hope you sue the police for every penny your family can get and more"
736,736,"Lets get one thing clear here, The gentleman was not pushed to the ground! He was Slammed to the ground by two police officers !"
737,737,"""Officer safety"" Yeah ok buddy, if an old man who poses no threat makes you fear for you life, you should move to a deserted island and cut of contact with humans."
738,738,So sad
739,739,"I saw the vidio the cop was the aggressor ,saw him trip that poor guy,I am glad they fired that idiot!& was charged!"
740,740,"The whole ""you must speak English"" thing is bs"
741,741,"the defense attorney should stand against the court for this stupid remarks,,,"
742,742,No wonder if Americans call police for mosquito bites or a dog in the empty street like this. 🤦‍♂️🙆‍♂️ That street looks like a empty ghost town.
743,743,Find the low life  string him up his family up his relatives up
744,744,Cops were lucky that old man was from Gujarat not UP or Haryana
745,745,they give him toy for apologies...🤭
746,746,This is embarrassing btw he wasn’t charged
747,747,The police officer who did this has been reinstated
748,748,They violated his rights while violating his rights.
749,749,Welcome to America 😞
750,750,Belive me if you come to India and you dont speak 4200 native languages we'll put you down 😂🤣😑
751,751,First of all you can’t just expect somebody to come to country and instantly know their language and and actually English was not the original language of America!
752,752,Indians people don't harm are people we have a history to take revenge 🤣😂
753,753,But one thing we Indians need to learn from America. I must say they have one of the best and strict Laws in the world. In India our entire system is corrupted and police are like gangsters who beat small vendors and charge them money to run there business..
754,754,This is Alabama what do you expect
755,755,Pushed to the ground?  Surely you mean slammed to ground
756,756,there was small respect left for America and i guess it seems that will be gone too in short time.
757,757,Some security officers want to be cops. Some cops want to be GESTAPO.
758,758,"Defund the police! People shouldn't have to give up their culture to live the American ""dream""."
759,759,This is AMERICA this happens everyday foreigner or citizen alike
760,760,"The cop needs to be in jail, the city owes a few million in damages......."
761,761,This is why we have protesting now...
762,762,I feel so bad for this guy. The cops did worse to me than this years ago. Just for playing some gospel music in my yard.
763,763,Wrong use of force!
764,764,barbaric act by police officer
765,765,"I can understand gujrati partially he said as soon as the searched his pockets along with his handkerchief ""supari"" too fell down supari is some kind of powder of betel nuts"
766,766,"You see how the story turn out, the police again changed the life of a man in a way that you would thing an enemy would. If a rubber or a killer does this it will be more acceptable to understand but for armed police men to simply respond to a call and then after making contact with the individual Mrs up with this level of conduct, like this is not a man that can escalate any thing. It shows how lawless police officer are, they are very disrespectful of the people they save and such individuals who wear police uniform and act in such a manner should be held accountable. The police guy is big fool, if you are out to help people has a police officer, you should feel grossly affected by how this ended but most times it's hypocricy, like thief's when they are cut,they start to say all kind of nice things. You check somebodies pocket, no weapon, he mentioned his house address, a smart police officer can figure out things from there but it's like there mind is set,  once you are not a friend, then you are seen as an enemy,"
767,767,"A man is walking down the road minding his own business someone calls the police ""I've never seen him before"" for which police should really tell them ""so what"" instead they show up and break his neck.  And that POS person who called them, I hope they get robbed of everything."
768,768,"Is this the way to take an old man to the ground ? Even a healthy young man can get injured by this , totally uncivilized inhumane behaviour"
769,769,I dont see the old can resist those police officers by any means ....they should respect every old man ...and i dont see any issue if he is walking on a side walk .....if its india police must have been asked back by ppls that do you have any warrant or written orders ???  US police exaggerating its law enforcement way more than anything
770,770,I enjoyed it
771,771,they never get convicted in criminal court just sued in civil  court
772,772,USA need learn something from UK
773,773,That Son seems very decent but I would not be that kind toward the person who did that to my father. And I don't mean a lawsuit. If that guy is re-hired as a cop anywhere we should all DOX his ass. Take a new job but never one where you can have the ability and authority to abuse or kill people and just 'get fired' for it. Disgusting country we have at times.
774,774,please cop come to India please step on our soil
775,775,I think the caller should be held responsible
776,776,If same happened in India then the whole country will be scrutonized.
777,777,I’m afraid of cops.
778,778,Disgraceful af!
779,779,Atleast they are taking actions against injustice unlike here in India police would have put all pending cases and lock you down for long
780,780,So two trials and jury still cant find the cop guilty wtf more do you need slamming an old frail man to the floor cops parents must be proud of him   not !!!!
781,781,Hahaha 🤣 🤣 🤣 so funny
782,782,These cop should go to the Jail
783,783,The caller should have been charged with accessory to attempted murder for being the whole reason this man was even in this situation to begin with..cop should have attempted murder charges to.
784,784,"Actually, The person who called the police should be the first to be charged."
785,785,That was so sad and horrible what I just saw what thy did to the elderly man. Now because of the policemen he's paralyzed. I just want to let the officers know is that what goes around comes back and it's going to hit you hard. 🐷
786,786,462 cops gave this video a 👎🏼
787,787,"“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, 
the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. 
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, 
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” "
788,788,A barbaric India like this will never happen. Ask tourists coming to India from abroad if you know about India
789,789,"Caller: Oh yeah! This guy was committing a federal felony. OMG, he’s taking a walk! What a crime! He should be getting life in prison for walking! Wow what a serious and horrendous crime, an Indian being a normal person!"
790,790,Dam shame
791,791,"3:05 so...in that case, let's use excessive force on Americans who doesn't speak any Indian languages in India."
792,792,"If that cop comes to India and doesn't know hindi, well...... Let's just make sure he doesn't become paralyzed 😏"
793,793,❤🇺🇸🇨🇦❤
794,794,Just send all the bills to the mayor
795,795,push to the ground?? are you joking me?  the word is SLAM
796,796,Prayer for healing ! John 3:16
797,797,It is very disappointing behavior 😠😠
798,798,"FOLLOW U.S LAWS AND SPEAK ENGLISH!!! There is no official language for America, and what late did he break? All he broke was his neck."
799,799,EVIL EVIL EVIL EVIL
800,800,"Wait so your telling me, he broke his neck just because he didn’t follow commands, but HOW THE FUCK was he supposed to listen if he didn’t understand anything hat he was saying"
801,801,Why they r using this much force when person isn't posing any threat?
802,802,My blood is boiling 😠😠😠😠😠😠😖😖😖
803,803,So sad and for no good reason..   the neighbor should be ashamed of himself for helping ruin this man's life...
804,804,Боже! Какая пустыня
805,805,Pushed to the ground?? That man was slammed into next week…..
806,806,now i know what black brother go through
807,807,Old man not able to speak ur language is the crime to break his neck... WTF....who can anyone do that to an old Man....
808,808,Today you have economic growth and military strength. One day it will not help at all. We will not do what you did on that day when India will be a superpower
809,809,Very good.
810,810,The jury failed to reach a verdict typical and the defence we expect people to follow our laws and speak our language when they come to our country like he was breaking the law and Americans speak the language of all the countries they go to.
811,811,Me watching Indians & Americans arguing in the comment section at 3:00 am 🌚
812,812,That`s what makes America Great.
813,813,"I'm Indian and i couldn't understand him i think he is speaking Gujrati? Cause he is from gujrat.

Edit: wasn't expecting the video :(
Fuck it made me sad i feel bad for idolising the US police's way of professionalism."
814,814,Sheme on us police
815,815,Cop got his job back in 2016.
816,816,"Americans 4 sure if u dont know someone  y dont u just make an effort  to know  the person, now u are making  every stranger a criminal,  now see the cost."
817,817,Well he moved to wrong state ..
818,818,when us people come to india we dont say to learn HINDI language we respect all the nation around the world not a language...Humanity matters.Not religion not language not color.
819,819,"AND NO AMERCIAN SPEAK ABOUT IT NICE , THIS HOW U GUYS TREAT INDIANS"
820,820,"That's American way of Saying "" Welcome to America Bit**"""
821,821,"I didn't know that before but there is no official language in USA, because its contains of a lot of nationalities I guess. So if he couldn't speak English that's ok"
822,822,"Please, send this police to India .we will give him a special treat"
823,823,Walking w/brown skin. What a sad impression to give a new immigrant.
824,824,"Aside from the police being pigs per usual
did you guys see how all of this started from a call from a Karen? She should’ve just minded her business!!!"
825,825,they knew then they blame him because he what ? What did he do ? officer just said he knew he did not speak so why would you keep demanding him to.  common sense why would the cop do that he is a sick twisted creature fire him and charge him with assault
826,826,WHO called the police on Mr. Patel?
827,827,"The caller is sick in the mind and the cop's are just plain evil, it seems a game for Americans to hurt innocent people. Jail time for the cop."
828,828,He wasn't pushed to the ground. He was slammed to the ground head first.
829,829,U should be very angry. They show no no hospitality to a senior 😂 person who can't speak English. An was brutal to a humble senior person. They should be ashame of themselves.
830,830,"Indians are good at forgiving, not at forgetting. ""Let them forgive but don't let them forget""."
831,831,all three officers should have been locked up for at least 10 years look where they left the patrol car  .  The Jury and the Judge should be in the same cell  .
832,832,How is this old man a threat to 2 police officers
833,833,"Next time a saw i white us old guy here in india I'll talk to him nicely and show him our culture.

US-sorry we don't do that here"
834,834,This bbn is ridiculous police need to leave people alone quit stopping people on the streets
835,835,I hope they got millions
836,836,The police is at fault...but It's also  fault of that son who let his father go out without teaching the old dude English.
837,837,"Isn't there more Spanish speakers than English in the USA? So remind me, what is the official language of the USA? And what language did the officers use when speaking to him?"
838,838,this is very bad behaviour by US police
839,839,Why they need to throw people down when they can handle them easily
840,840,Now let the Americans come to India we will show what we are 😈😈
841,841,...and cops wonder why .....
842,842,Thats ur police hmm showing ur power on old uncle u say ur the power full country all over the world  and doing this like of stuffs shame on u  in our country we respect ur people  bcoz we believe a guest is a god
843,843,India have over 800 language he better make sure he speak all of them before coming to india
844,844,😂😂😂😂😅
845,845,Never ever stepping in USA
846,846,Damn shame! White man gets away with a Criminal act
847,847,"I thought America is safe. But if there own police can't take care of their own citizens and discriminate among them, then I don't think it's safe to travel America as a tourist. Disappointed with such news 😔"
848,848,"Honestly he got lucky that this happened on video. Other ways they would charge shit out of him and get his ass deported long time ago. 
I personally know case in Chicago they shot old man no reason at all(only crime he didn't speak English) and nothing happened. I had two idiots pulled guns  on me few months back and accused  me of stealing my own truck ( I drive commercial work truck with custom color that only idiot would steal ) just because they read my plates wrong and I couldn't even get there names ."
849,849,"He wasn't pushed. He was thrown down.
Reason ?? "" He doesn't speak a lick of English""."
850,850,Immigrants decendents getting mad because you don't speak a language that they were taught while forgetting the languages and cultures they were
851,851,Here is a question for the defense team of this despicable man with a badge. What is our language? Because last time I checked the United States has no official language. Shame on them for trying to use a language barrier as a defense for this action against a person who has not committed a crime in the first place because once again not speaking the language this person with a badge and gun thinks should be spoken is not a crime.
852,852,"There was a language barrier
Thene you should not come to India even if you know hindi 😌"
853,853,what were charges made.
854,854,That Attorney should be charged with racism and threatening behavior saying you come here speak English or else.
855,855,He is a young punk officer who needs more training or he will end up in Jail
856,856,Is it a sin to go for a jog in the  US...I mean I know about American's obesity problem but that doesn't mean that everyone else can't perform a healthy routine
857,857,That’s disgusting.  The police are supposed to be the good guys!
858,858,they’re saying he wasn’t complying but i literally don’t see that in the slightest..
859,859,LoL police felt threat by an old skinny man . Shameful
860,860,"Does it mean that all American visiting India are expected to know Hindi? Else upon questioning will be wrestled down? 
They could have just handcuffed him taken him to the police station and called an Indian to interpret what he had to say. "
861,861,Wait the caller said a black man he does not fit the discretion so right there the cop knew he was not the person but still stoped him
862,862,I'm angry for him.
863,863,So sorry for the poor Indian.
864,864,"This shows to all how bad are cops in USA,this man was only in america 1 week,he ends off half paralyzed, he spent his life time in India without any problems,1 week he was nearly dead.this is america today"
865,865,"We should follow the same when an American visits India, every new state you travel a new language you need to speak 😂"
866,866,"Some us cops are very rude, even with us people that's why they got shots."
867,867,"A neighbor spotted him walking around, I would say the neighbor is racist fearing the man is Muslim. Shame on the neighbor."
868,868,That is not fair mr. Parker
869,869,Jesus christ! He was nowhere near as imposing enough to warrant a tackle like that from those pigs.
870,870,Now I will wait for an american to meet on street and lets see how I deal
871,871,"Hold on my fellow brown panthers calling for violence against tourists. Don't forget your values because of them... 
Athiti Devo Bhava ( Guests are God) . And remember what Gandhi said, An eye for an eye the entire world will go blind. Calm down ..this is just one incident, let's hope for better times."
872,872,"Next time if I see any US stranger in my country India, I will call the police."
873,873,Why should you go out alone if you don't know or understand that place's language
874,874,Интересно какую угрозу предстовлял этот старик?
875,875,"caller of 911 must go to jail,,,"
876,876,PLEASE MR COP CONVERT BACK TO GOD ASK FORGIVENESS AND TO THE FAMILY JESUS IS ALL MERCIFULLY IN GOD'S WORLD YOU CAN SPEAK ANY TONGUE GOD BLESS US FOR BEING SINERS
877,877,"what can we expect from country which is more influenced by charli d'amelio,Logan Paul,Cardi B,6ix9ine,james charles,Joe Biden ,SJW ,Angry feminist then ben shapiro,Michael J. Knowles,Charlie Kirk,Elon Musk or in other words people with brains and logics"
878,878,The person who called police should be changed to
879,879,"2:58 WTF Robert Tuten, defense attorney"
880,880,He should sue and cops lose there jobs
881,881,"This is the first time i saw.. all the countries get united to break American citizen neck if they don't communicate in their regional language.. Feel pity,, cos India got several languages and if goes state to state,, his neck will be used t make stew.."
882,882,Shame on these police officers...
883,883,These people decide the democracy index and freedom index of other countries! What a joke!!!
884,884,What do they mean follow our laws it wasn’t committing any crimes they had no probable cause a reasonable suspicion sidewalks go through people’s driveways and yes if you’re walking down the side way you’re in multiple people’s driveways it is not a crime and he didn’t have to answer their questions and because he wasn’t committing a crime he would not have to produce ID they did not have the right to warrant Leslie search his pockets he was free to go anytime because he wasn’t being detained for a crime suspicion is not a felony or a misdemeanor they assaulted him plain and simple
885,885,"Actually, the USA does not have an official language. You are free to speak any language you like."
886,886,What happened to the cop? Is he working again now that he has destroyed some poor INNOCENT PERSON's life?
887,887,these people have no respect for old people
888,888,Very bad this police officer should be suspended for this action 😡🤬
889,889,They are in jail?  I doubt it
890,890,He needs justice American police are the
891,891,"So you think,  nobody can walk in neighborhood.  You don't own it.  Karma  will come around."
892,892,Mazah agaya good work U.S❤️❤️
893,893,He wasn't pushed he was slammed to the ground..get it right!
894,894,The case has gone to court TWICE!? But the jury hasn't been able to come up with a unanimous result? Welcome to AmeriKKKa.
895,895,"Walking is un-American.  If you must walk, use a treadmill, and do it decently, in private."
896,896,"I'm scared and angry at the same time. And i don't think America is a good place for me to visit. 
But you are welcome to India whether you know or don't know Hindi."
897,897,Revenge is in order.
898,898,He was slammed to the ground not pushed.
899,899,At least we know that we are the ones making humans become extinct think about that lol it's actually a valid point
900,900,"Hey are you a lawyer Robert Tuten ,  There are so many people do not speak English in USA,  many American do not speak foreign languages when they travel to foreign country.     What the cop did dead wrong putting the man down he didn't have the any weapon."
901,901,"Wow i am impressed that force is too much for impact on his spine ,and 2 people wow,I know white people think they are superior and all but I don't have enough brains to think about these concepts ,even if you are superior to me ,It doesn't matter ,all matters to me is food .home ,life ,ya know just living ..."
902,902,"Peter your delusional, get your head out of the sand!"
903,903,should sue the 911 caller
904,904,I'm angry.. But Jesus Christ taught to forgive people ..do good to those who hurt you and pray for them
905,905,It's okay. Indians are doing the same thing to the northeast peoples in many metropolitan city in India.. When our friends or family members are hurt by somebody. Our whole family feel pain and angry. Same thing happen to others too..So treat everyone equal
906,906,"Speak our language? First of all its our language, ENGLISH. Also what's the offical language of the USA? That's right, they don't have one."
907,907,SWEEET HOOOME ALABAMAA
908,908,It's called gane violence
909,909,Racism happens in India too but this just another level !!
910,910,The only reason why the cop had for slamming the older gentleman to is because he kept walking home. He didn't hurt the cop and  the cop knew he didn't understand English.
911,911,"''officer safety'' ????????really             what about that old man safety ,?????  its all about the power , you think you have the gun and the badge   you can do WHATEVER YOU WANT ??????    unbelievable"
912,912,"Starting to thinking maybe we need to do that to some white skin foreigners like that if they stranger to us also, right? hehehe. US Police , what a shame, can't understand the excessive force using"
913,913,"Why use excessive force?? Clearly the old man is not resisting arrest.... Oh i know,, because he is a tough 27y/o guy beating up a 58y/o grandpa....."
914,914,Eric Parker is a demon!
915,915,So sorry
916,916,Omg
917,917,Poor old man. KARMA will  handle the matter soon or later.
918,918,Follow are lows hes walking down the road and has a cop atack him
919,919,The callers should be arrested for these innocent lives for false arrest  i hope the caller watching this that you the caller is guilty of a crime shame on the caller and no appoligies at all they should sue them too.cant people talk to   people findout how they are how they doing say high or greet someone with respect
920,920,He still plans to stay permanently in US despite how he was treated. That means come what may will not go back to India.
921,921,"""Pushed"" to the ground? LOL   How about ""BODY SLAMMED""."
922,922,So anyone caming to india they have to learn more than one language.  So that's not a excuse. It's so shameful what Americans think they are  right and others are always wrong.
923,923,If it was in india and happened in a village I bet the cop would be on streets in no time..with torn clothes and slippers around his neck...
924,924,Start loving your own country. You won’t face these kind of issues
925,925,If I met this thing of a person I would point him to the nearest hospital for mental health issues. What type of cop does this. Big hard man showing off to the woman cop. When if fact the word COP COWARD COMES TO MIND.
926,926,THAT cop was worried about officer safety from an 80 yr old man that probably weighs about 130 pounds!!!??? Put that officer in jail that way he can practice his body slamming techniques on someone that can use that same technique on smashing his face into the jail cell bars EVERYDAY. What a scumbag.
927,927,Since when it is illegal to walk on the side walk or not being able to speak English in the USA ? What if the Indian police broke the necks of the tens of thousands of Americans living in India for taking their walks or for not being able to speak Urdu?
928,928,This brutal   injuring of a man happened when we had a Democratic president in the White House.  We need police reform.
929,929,"I saw a Patel jaywalking on the street and when a white guy honked at him he started cursing like bhenchod, madharchod to him. Surprisingly his wife was with him and she was totally ok with him cursing.  It was a Indian area.
Thankfully the white didn't understand a word only could see that he is a old guy and was angry and he responded by saying can you please move or you can get into an accident. Patel cursed him again chodina tari ma no bhosdo."
930,930,"I don’t speak English, easy so get a translator. How can you not reach a verdict, the cop will get away again. They always do, let’s face it they get away with murder so this is nothing."
931,931,These cops are gonna be sorry.  The public is fed up
932,932,the united states has no official language so you can speak any language as you wish
933,933,Criminal land
934,934,"This is hard to watch. I hate the current riots, but then I'm seeing all these cops doing things from years ago and I'm not sure how i can back up a cop no more sadly it's not what i want but the facts are forcing me to. I suppose theres some good cops but we gotta figure a way to deal with the bad ones."
935,935,"I hate it when they start out with the ole ""Hey Bud"". That just burns my A$$. I'm not your bud and you mean me no ""Earthly Good"". So in that sense, Don't call me your ""Bud"". The son has the heart of a saint, Because I would have nothing but animosity and anger for anyone who changed my loved ones quality of life!"
936,936,"No excuse he didn't even do move a limb, that cop was way too edgy. Good riddance."
937,937,3:05 this is the reason why certain people don't care about the United States this country has a sense of expecting the world to speak English or go back to your country mindset
938,938,"😂 gujurat guy , I feel bad because he is elderly but if it happened to his son instead of him, I would have said he deserved it, I hate these gujuratis selfish people"
939,939,"You should have been fired. Monster!!!. You all like to hurt people. Children, women you don't care. Some of these videos make me cry that you can treat anther Human that way heartless"
940,940,"You should have been fired. Monster!!!. You all like to hurt people. Children, women you don't care. Some of these videos make me cry that you can treat anther Human that way heartless"
941,941,"This ""Color Thing"" Has Been Going On For Over 500 years, And I Don't See It Stopping, Anytime Soon, Only Difference THE World Is Seeing This RACISM, And It's Ugly And Painful To The Affected CITIZENS And The World.....GOD Have Mercy On The INOCENT, UNARMED MEN/ WOMEN/CHILDREN....SHAMEFUL!!!"
942,942,Psychopaths always blame their victims.
943,943,Is caller proud ?
944,944,The only reason why the police assaulted the old man because the police couldn’t understand his language.
945,945,This is the reality of the America
946,946,"If we come for a holiday to US,  :-o we should speak your language, otherwise we can't Vista your country,  then your tourism will stop,  same rules apply for this police man. Sorry to say then he cannot visit any country,  first he need to learn our language. Poor police officer."
947,947,Gd this bs has to stop!
948,948,Bohot uccha hua
949,949,"A plays that was a problem, but the real cause was their egos getting hurt because he didn't follow orders the cop was just stupid he knew he couldn't speak English but kept ordering anyhow!"
950,950,SLAMMED! How did that look like a push?
951,951,That's very very sad now I would never see Americans in same way.
952,952,"wtf jst i see...
😤😤😡😡"
953,953,Good he got fired
954,954,Apparently he was fired but I bet he got a job as a cop in another town with no loss of pay or benefits. How is this type of lawlessness amongst the police force  and the legal system in general allowed to carry on.???  What would a cop like this one do to a person who was unable to speak (deaf and dumb) he would probably claim he was an alien  from outer space and shoot him and the judge would say well done officer you are promoted to sergeant. Your legal system beggars belief.    Mike   UK
955,955,"When US come to India make sure they knw how to speak Hindi, or else your neck will be broken."
956,956,Hahahahahahaha
957,957,Send that cop to India
958,958,You should change the habit according to the place
959,959,"I'm an Indian and Hindu   .. and such things happened in india too against muslims .. many muslims were killed just because they were identified as muslims ..
USA is more concern about the security of the nation especially after 9/11
Before commenting on American cops just look inside how our system ,law ,cops are behaving"
960,960,"Alabama. That says it all. That is not a stereotype, just reality"
961,961,When India became more powerful let's see how we treat America they should know they have mess with wrong country
962,962,Now he should learn english I agree with that. But the coo was wrong
963,963,the cop was wrong. He hurt what is obviously an old man..he may have had dementia..how would they know..just being bullies
964,964,This is how America treats u in America.. well done cops..
965,965,They beat him not because of language it's because of his colour. We in india respect foreigners and they fkin behave like this such a same US Police and what about fkin lawyers they said you must learn our language 😑😑
966,966,"That cop was trying to kill him  , luckily he didn't drop him on concrete but that was his intention,"
967,967,Going for walks around the neighbourhood is NORMAL in India. It should be normal anywhere. Why is it suspicious? Wtf.
968,968,"How do you go to court twice and jury cant come to an agreement!?!?!? When you come to this country you need to speak English, fuck land that isnt even yours, it was stolen!"
969,969,How stupid was that statement you come to our country we expect you to speak English? When you come to our country of go to other country they don't expect you to speak their language and most importantly they don't break your neck!
970,970,This is pure racism
971,971,I can't breathe
972,972,Americans i used to thought are good people ...but they should never do this to someone who is such old ..he wasn’t carrying anything except his handkerchief...they should have behaved with him as a human 😓
973,973,Maybe learn to speak English if you move to England?
974,974,Just send that ex officer to INDIA after he will know what will happen to his life.
975,975,If this man knew what was coming he would of ran away
976,976,"Alabama, nuff said"
977,977,Bhai to Gujarati chhe
978,978,I hope that officer gets sent to jail
979,979,Cop walked...government thugs never hang in America.
980,980,This cop should be locked up..as a American citizen..and charged.. million dollars law suit..should be filed...
981,981,Cop should be in prison
982,982,"He's expected to speak English and know our laws. Is this a joke or something or if Americans are going to India they r expected to know 150 different languages depending on the place they go and especially if hindi is not their mother tongue. Are Americans supposed to speak French when they come to Québec or go to France. Are they supposed to speak German, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Russian, mandarin, Urdu depending on where they go. That has got to be the stupidest defence ever."
983,983,Smh is a old man. that cop god will deal with him.beating an old . 58 year old man have nt to do with coming. To this country .
984,984,That terrible. People need to stop calling the police Everytime they see someone of color going about minding their business due to skin color.
985,985,"Indians be like ""atithi devo bhava"" Means gests are like God. Of any race any country. Shame on American , police department and justice Department."
986,986,That means any one can break Americans’ bone or neck when they  other foreign country will not be considered as crime .
987,987,ব্যাটা পুলিশের কলংক। ধন্যবাদ
988,988,The cop should be arrested
989,989,Alabama. Perfect.
990,990,"Tbh people who don't know English shouldn't be allowed into the country. Like wtf? I'm Indian myself and I hate it when people try to bring their mother tongue into my office or my professional workspace here in India itself. ENGLISH IS THE GLOBAL STANDARD And if you don't know it, you should remain local. Period."
991,991,"If you need everyone coming to US to know English, why do you have visa interviews in the mother tongue of an applicant? This defense attorney looks like an educated fool."
992,992,Officer safety? him being handcuffed and totally immobile was not safe enough?
993,993,This shit happened in The South!
994,994,What a racist statement from the defence.
995,995,Disgrace.
996,996,She said Huntsville first at the end she said Madison is she confused which one is it.
997,997,This is the USA
998,998,Now show me cases of Istanbul police doing this to Gujaratis. Glad to know who my friends and foes are.
999,999,Protect your culture Americans
1000,1000,Put him into jail
1001,1001,Power corrupts
1002,1002,They should first insert a brain in all police officers than than take actions carefully
1003,1003,🙂 there is nothing wromg with americans .... there are two sides evil and good and that policeman was evil 🙂
1004,1004,No wonder if you make India people image based on appu sterotype
1005,1005,You have to watch how to indian police arrest the people....
1006,1006,India managed to speak English ok
1007,1007,The cop is a no good liar. He knew what he was doing. He doesn't deserve to walk as a free man. He should be in jail right now. The family of the victim should sue him for everything he has and the police department. To see your own father disabled for life now.
1008,1008,"You lot are just overreacting, this is standard greeting in Alabama if you're not white"
1009,1009,"whats that stop for??? stupidity never end... especially with badge,guns and uniform"
1010,1010,Well nothing to complain same things happens in India. Nothing to yell or to be surprised about. This is worst in India.
1011,1011,Hahahahahahaha very good
1012,1012,"Defence attorney should know there is many american who dont know local language, should our police start doing the same you wont be able to handle your own logic. By the way! We have different langauge in different region and 22 of them are official"
1013,1013,Insult!
1014,1014,if this is the reason the court would accept then no tourist shall be allowed to go to other countries...surely they will go home with broken neck.
1015,1015,Eric Parker should have went to PRISON!
1016,1016,Suspended kre ese police valo ko
1017,1017,Gujarati che 😭
1018,1018,One more reason not to buy F21 from Them
1019,1019,"I heard Alabama,and my heart sank,horribly racist"
1020,1020,Le pays des fous en liberté et les innocents en prison
1021,1021,Why tf should he have been obliged to speak in English when he was going to be there only for a few months
1022,1022,"The officer obviously didn’t believe when he was said he was Indian... Karen said he’s a skinny black guy, so he’s a skinny black guy 🤷🏽‍♂️"
1023,1023,It can be ur father or loved one visiting other country
1024,1024,I'd like to bump into Eric Parker.
1025,1025,"I would like to ask the whites of USA 
Were you guys able to play GTA San Andreas as CJ is black 😂😂😂😂 and GTA 5 as Franklin is black or you started boycotting Rockstar games 😂😂😂😂"
1026,1026,"Eric Parker was stupid not the whole department, many are sacrificed their lives for you"
1027,1027,Speak our language!!!!! There iIt’s not official language in USA .... English ohhh ok I gott it in England not in other part of the world?
1028,1028,His big mistake was he looked black his second was no english and the third was he broke his own neck. You cannot blame the police all he had to do was stay in India.
1029,1029,If you dont understand i person why not try to understand a person & that caller should get sued also
1030,1030,"All charges dismissed against officer, he is back on the force."
1031,1031,"Language as an excuse for this incident is just a suicide bomb for U.S people to travel abroad cause we too will apply the same law.
At least that grandfather can speak English a little bit but when you come to India I bet my candy ass if you could reply a word of local dialect 😡😡😡 see ya all soon"
1032,1032,Welp a lot of neck breaking to do in Paris too I guess
1033,1033,i swear tht the person who called the cops was a karen
1034,1034,"first off....even though english is generally spoken in the US it is NOT the main language....and that should not be a requirement to live and work in the US. train your officers better in customer care/service and make it a mandate for the general communities to stop calling the police on minorities for things like walking, stopping, sitting, eating, talking ....they should have  trained community people who should investigate things like these not officers who are ignorant and trigger happy"
1035,1035,Dear Americans FYI I like to State that India has 22 official languages
1036,1036,I'm gonna just say HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA what the little piggy gonna do now be safe piggy they gonna love u in jail YOU GOT A PRETTY MOUTH PIGGY  lol hahaha
1037,1037,Police officer should be charged with Attempted murdered . Sue the police department for hiring this kind of creep.
1038,1038,Let me guess the police got a free paid vacation
1039,1039,"The defense lawyer was disgusting. Speak English and follow the laws, ok jack, what laws did Mr. Patel break?!? Oh, that’s right none."
1040,1040,"Caller: There is a black man wondering around our neighborhood.
Police: No worries, we are on our way. Just chill out.
Police: Hey you
Black man: No English, home 148, home 148."
1041,1041,😆😆😆
1042,1042,"India,usa allies"
1043,1043,Eric Parker is a psychopath
1044,1044,"American police needs to go back to train in the new day and age issues...stop using force, you are getting it wrong too many times."
1045,1045,Wow !! Jury is not sure if crime is committed ??  Seriously ??  Jury deserves harsher punishment than police officer who broke the neck !!!   Mentally Sick Police and Jury !!
1046,1046,you must be able to speak USA English to go to the USA
1047,1047,Its not justified to blame all americans for this. The Americans whom i met are really nice and very friendly. Policemen are usually rude in every corner of the world. Americans speak against injustice against anyone. This policeman should be charged for this offence.......
1048,1048,Guess we can’t or aren’t allowed to walk down our neighborhood streets anymore.
1049,1049,A thousand plagues on the caller.
1050,1050,But guns are no threat at all.... What's wrong with you America?! :(
1051,1051,the judge seems like a clearly racist person and the woman who called the cops as well is 100 % racist i believe and the cops should be given 3 years imprison and a heavy fine as well besides suspending them and they should start fining the people who call the cops on innocent people especially on black people and giving them wrong information which lead to the gentleman's poor state.
1052,1052,"Wow!!! This country is getting more and more fucked up every year, that is why I keep my peeps close and my enemies far away. I can use the racism card, but it’s every where, and it’s getting old anyways."
1053,1053,He was slammed  not push
1054,1054,"What the hell is the cop is saying. He definitely must be terminated. If the cop goes to  India, China or Timbuktu must he speak the language of these countries. If he is unable to speak the languages of these countries has the cops in these countries the right to injure him like he did this old grandfather. This cop is nincompoop he has no ethics"
1055,1055,he was thrown...not pushed
1056,1056,Where i am now there are guys that will give away their dessert for a FULL YEAR to have the privilege of being the first on Eric Porker.
1057,1057,WHY WAS HE NOT KILL FOR NO ENGLISH

1068,1068,If any American wishes to visit India then learn all the officially recognised languages .
1069,1069,American think that all other people are treat to them F to all those people who think that
1070,1070,So sad so bad police officer. He is old man nothing them to be fear.. Even he is illegal stay..  Police officers are young why should do that. It's wrong should punishment. Blessing you dear dad. From Sri Lanka
1071,1071,"Pushed?  Power bombed him hella hard. And he didn't mean to hurt him? Was sad to know how fast they came.  Didn't ask him where you stay? Or try to intrepid him. Maybe we find out which house maybe they speak English?  
Common sense classes or training is needed"
1072,1072,He was labeled as a black guy so there you go. Tackled for being black.

1090,1090,ALL COPS ARE BAF
1091,1091,"The way he flipped him over, clearly that white guy hated brown skin Indians, act of racism, not an inch of doubt in my mind."
1092,1092,"Many Foreigner comes to India and they are unable to speak our any language. So what the people of foreign countries specifically US's people expect from us? Should we Indian break their neck, hand, legs?.. Shame on ur system."
1093,1093,What law did he break and bullshit not a language only with the dude who broke his neck

1124,1124,Ok ideally all the American people should be speaking native (Red Indian) language according the police officers point isn't it ??
1125,1125,Now don't tell me it's not a racism
1126,1126,"How on earth can the defense say that they expect everyone who comes to the USA to speak English? ! What kind of rubbish is that? How many immigrants from Germany, Italy, Poland, aRussia etc., spoke English when they first got to the States? That’s some racist bullshit and a very lame excuse!"
1127,1127,"Racist defence attorney. But, what do I expect? That's USA, racism is strong. I can speak English at least to the point to answer the police like that, but gladly  I never ever dream to come to the USA. Land of people who mind other people'a business like the caller."

1141,1141,"This policeman should be put to jail....no excuse for his arogance and feeling above the law.  Policemen should pay people they hurt and not the state paying , staze paying equals policemen turning into bullies."

1158,1158,__Waiting desperately to interact with an AMERICAN WHO IS visiting INDIA __ I promise YOU ALL  if he or she couldn’t speak any of our 1600 languages __ he ll face the same or worse
1159,1159,What will happen if we started doing this to white people ?
1160,1160,"Bhosdika police,"
1161,1161,The pushing down from back technique is wrong. The police officers should not contact the neck and spine. Poor take down technique. Hope they improve on that.
1162,1162,Everything is rigged
1163,1163,SHAMLESS officer how can he attack an innocent brutally. Does he thinks its heroism

Shame yourself!
Why Americans are so racist?"
1166,1166,"American police are very rude. Not only police but also some people. 
Unnecessarily Very often people call police couse they are very impatient? And they called themselves literate!
Imagine just walking around is a crime in Usa, especially if you are new there."
1167,1167,Wtf
1168,1168,Cowards
1169,1169,Us police recentyl killed a black boy because he was playing with toy gun

1176,1176,"Cop should be charged w attempted murder n illegal use of force. This is America people. Land of the free, a place of opportunities. Shouldn't matter who u r or where ur from u should be treated right and the same. Poor guy was just out firca walk n BAM  attracted by a cop f iui r no reason. Being a suspicious person walking in the area really is not a crime hell it's not even a felony or misdemeanor. Profiling someone should be a felony for the cops. They could of just stayed away see where he was going. Smh... I hope he sues the fuck out of them"

1182,1182,Amercian 🇺🇸🤝🇮🇳❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Gujarati person
1183,1183,Because he didn’t speak English. What that cop said was so wrong. Why did he have to speak English?  Would that cop learn Italian if he decided to go to Rome for vacation?  Probably not. They don’t have to speak our language to visit their children and grandchildren. That’s a ridiculous statement.
1184,1184,"Жил в США 20 лет. Имею некоторый опыт, в том числе и общения с ""полицией"". Почему в кавычках? Потому, что это уже давно не полиция. Это банды отморозков и садистов, психопатов и убийц, которые творят что хотят, прикрываясь своей формой. Их ненавидят прежде всего нормальные люди, которых они обязаны защищать, в теории, а на практике ведут себя как фашисты на оккупированной территории, смотря на всех остальных людей как на недочеловеков. Подчеркну, что они творят абсолютный беспредел не только с неграми. Найдите в Википедии статью death of Kelly Thomas, прочитайте. И такое происходит в США регулярно, с нулевыми последствиями для убийц в форме. В самом худшем случае, их всего лишь... увольняют."

1190,1190,"There are rotten apples everywhere US police is no exception. The point here is that- the Indian government remains unfazed by these atrocities committed on its diaspora even today. And we as Indians don't give a shit either, what else would explain the exodus to US from India. Have the numbers dwindled? So chill...we deserve this treatment. The desperate will always be greeted with insults."

The few who commit such hate crimes, remember, English may be your official language but don’t ever goddamn forget that yours is a nation of immigrants. Add to that, you’re tarnishing the image of a country with millions of good people and inspirational personalities like JFK, MLK, RFK and so on."

1248,1248,Even Gandhi is not safe in amerikkka
1249,1249,Those racist cop should go to prison.
1250,1250,Terrible
1251,1251,So Americans should learn hindi when they came to india.
1252,1252,"So is there a rule that if you come to America (from another country) you have to speak English??. Um, English is not our official language, in fact, united states doesn't have an ""official"" language, Natives ""american"" had their own language far before Dutch french or german came along and took the 13 colonies... English was introduced In the 17th century in America... Ignorance at its best..."

Are u kidding me... 27 year old armed with another armed officer(bully) is confronting a 60 year old frail guy, throws him to the ground like he is in WWF tag team match... what a shame. Tif he felt a threat the other officer could have just held his hand and handcuffed him. Why the heck would u trash him to the groung just 'cause he didnt speak ur language and u ran out of patience👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 fellow north indians, hindi is not the universal language..english is. High time to learn english"
1257,1257,"The Call was racist. The cop was too young, immature & possibly racist. 
The Lawyer is DEFINITELY RACIST as FSck! 
I'm surprised this didn't turn into ""Indian Lives Matter"" movement.
May be the cop took him down thinking he was a ""black guy"" OR ""native American"" (having no idea of the actual Indian race)."
1258,1258,"So any tourist goes to Japan, china or Germany, who doesn't speak their language can expect a beat down like that ???? What kind of logic is that?"
1259,1259,That's fuckn America in all
1260,1260,This incident makes me to stick with  my parents All the times...
1261,1261,This is so disturbing I am actually sick to my stomach! This poor man was here 1 week and they ruined his life because he was walking?? The cops clearly knew he didnt speak English and he was in no way resisting. I hope this family wins a MAJOR lawsuit!

Every time I had problems I called 911 they always ready to help I know sometime few accidents happened. We  feel safe because police. In India or other countries police is not too good.
1269,1269,"They could have just walked to his house. Also, in what way could this elderly guy endanger that young, fit, Male officer?!?! Officer just wanted to hurt him."
1270,1270,"Seriously, a neighbor call on stranger who’s 55 year old walking on a side walk? And police didn’t ask where u live? take us there? 
Police man didn’t even had remorse in court? Nor judgement was fair. I would sue the police department for lack of judgment in training and causing injury to citizens."
1271,1271,It was excessive use of force...way too much..that poor Man..
1272,1272,Dude that was outta pocket.. man broke his neck.. I like how they look back at the car camera . He was stopped with no weapons 🤔😐 need 3.8mill

1277,1277,"When you come to India we expect you to follow our laws and speak our language, we never treat any one badly but denying his charges makes racism of course they will take favour of thier police man rather than other man  so better comeing in India you should know 1630 Indian languages better not get killed by the public in India"

1291,1291,Cops safety 😂
1292,1292,there was a signal between the officers right before they did the take down the man was clearly unaware but it shows on video really bad they need to be jail for attempted murder clowns
1293,1293,Poor guy. Didn’t do anything. So glad they filed charges on him.
1294,1294,"Correct me if I'm wrong but Is it true, a court case from 2000 where a judge in the court of appeals of NY upheld the lower courts decision that THE POLICE COULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU FOR SCORING TOO HIGH ON AN IQ TEST TO JOIN THE FORCE? 

Another reason this kind of police mentality is growing; because intelligence is being discriminated against. "
1295,1295,This is crazy i cant believe it
1296,1296,I don't find any specific mistake by the Indian then why you punish him??
1297,1297,Shame on USA

1304,1304,When you to us you have to speak english and if you come to india you have to speak hindi.
1305,1305,That cop should be in jail excessive force big time out of line
1306,1306,He is an old man. Such a force is unnecessary.

1309,1309,If the old man dont like it here hes free to leave.
1310,1310,Cop is despicable
1311,1311,American should speak Hindi and other Indian languages (about 20+) when they come to India. According to the Defense Attorney. NO  English.
1312,1312,That lawyer is doing his job. Being a piece of crap saying Mr. Patel is in the wrong for walking. Who was the dingle berry that called after seeing him the last 4 days. I bet they were watching out the front window and enjoying the entertainment!
1313,1313,"Its not the polices fault hes just ""doing his job"" its american laws that are backwards, they train there police to use these kinds of tactics to provoke an aggressive or protective  reaction from the individual its text book. Cases like this where the cop loses his job is great, though its not only the individuals fault but that of the institution that trained these officers, not only should these officers have lost there job but also the defence minister allowing the public to be so readily assaulted and detained simply to generate revenue is a crime not to mention the thickheadness of the defence attorney insinuating that this man being attacked could have been avoided if he spoke english."
1314,1314,THIS GUY IS GOING TO GET A HUGE SETTLEMENT.

Tbh he could be walking for exercise or something but does he look like he is going to bomb your house like why call the police on him 🤦‍♂️.
1347,1347,As per America... Americans should learn other country languages other wise they will face this type of situations when they go other countries 🙏
1348,1348,"What if you came to India and we did that to you. Would you be okay with it. Do remember indian people are not violent, Its not like we are some terrorist.

1386,1386,Brainless cop. Have some commonsense to differentiate between criminals and non criminal's. He should be punished for crippling others life. Using such force for not understanding other person and giving reasons that he couldn't understand other language is just not acceptable. If he claims that elder person couldn't speak in English than he should have atleast observed the body language used non formal communications.. common even animals understand and communicate. Some day if he travels to other country learn all the languages spoken in that country otherwise someone should break his neck
1387,1387,Indian people's love to go america.now go and enjoy
1388,1388,I will not go to america after seeing how the people think any unfamiliar harmless elderly person just walking off the street and cripple him by forcefully dropping him on the ground on attempt to detain him... very unprofessional and unmoralistic act by that cop....
1389,1389,"What an excuse, the USA has NO OFFICIAL language. English is not the Official language of the USA, it is just the most widely spoken.

1392,1392,"Being a logical Indian, I think the blame lies in Testosterone rather than America."
1393,1393,this is racial profiled.
1394,1394,Disgusting.. terrible.. tears fell from my eyes watching Mr. Patel.. shameful act by American police.
1395,1395,if americans coming in india they must speak hindi then
1396,1396,Sorry India this is not all of America I was treated by an Indian doctor for allergy's we where buddies I was in my teens 1970's

1411,1411,"એ ભઈ હારું સે પટેલ કાકા નાં ગજવા માઠી પડીકી નીકળી જો સૂડી નીકળી હોત તો ધોળીયા ઓ ગાંડા જ થઈ જાત.. અને આવું મહીંસાણા મા પોલિસે કર્યું હોત તો એને ઊંધો ઘાલી દીધો હોત

હું તો આખા ભારત મા ગમે ત્યાં જવ તો પણ ગુજરાતી જ ફાડું અને બધાઈ હમજી જાય એલા.."
1412,1412,Whats the point of recommending this after four years?    One bad incident doesn't mean a country is unliveable.
1413,1413,"This cop and his partner should have to pay all medical bills, pain, and bonus compensation for being dumb. They should have taken him home found out what he was doing and then went to the racist caller and straightened him/her out. That frail old man couldn't harm a fly let alone two burly police officers. If they are that afraid, they are in the wrong business. All that being said, if he knew he was coming to America to stay he should have taken a beginning English class. Just so he can say no English, where is the bathroom. I live at..... my phone number is.......  most Americans learn that much when traveling abroad. I find if I make an attempt at their language and use some hand gestures I usually get taken pity on and shown what I need. Or they find an English speaker for me. I also learn please and thank you."
1414,1414,T series supporter huh
1415,1415,Stupid neighbor.  There is no crime in walking down the street.
1416,1416,This is USA...lol.
1417,1417,Aur jao America
1418,1418,"Not surprised at all, this is America."
1419,1419,Why leave your own country stay and you can say this is my country get lost cops
1420,1420,Unnecessary violence toward older gentleman. I wonder how they can do something like this to old person.
1421,1421,"Wow this is terrible, I've seen lots of other videos on YouTube about US cops being very cruel and bad, therfore I can safely assume all cops in US are brutality, what a dangerous place to live everyone should fear for their lives"
1422,1422,"You always hear about the bad stuff police do, never the good stuff."
1423,1423,Great injustice by the federal court.
1424,1424,"Common he was an old man with no threat, dont understand english , never expected this from police"
1425,1425,OMG I can't believe. This was criminal act. I hope they will sue this policy officer
1426,1426,Innocent person. The cops deliberately tackled him that way.
1427,1427,Is outrageous and inhuman to behave like this.
1428,1428,I Feel sorry for this man.
1429,1429,How inhuman 😡
1430,1430,"On my first trip in India. I was on a train during Durga Puja week, the trip was full beyond belief. I was sitting five cars down from my friend who had both our tickets printed on one ticket. The ticket conductor came and asked for my ticket I said in English my friend has our tickets and pointed to the right. He told me get up. And then pushed me and said ""ticket!"" and then pushed me again to the right so I started walking to my friend 5 cars up with the ticket inspector shoving me and shouting. I cut my head (Im from UK and 6ft 1 tall on the metal bulkhead between the cars because this man was pushing me constantly. Eventually we reached my friend and showed the ticket and the ticket collector went away. That was within 48 hours of arriving in India just to show there are two sides to every story."
1431,1431,"I have seen some stupid police stuff but that was cowardly, unnecessary and the guy's firing was correct. Period.

Justified use of force my ass. Just because you're scared of your own shadow, boy.... doesn't mean you get to throw people to the ground."
1432,1432,Ppl be in ur own country..u will never b treated like that.
1433,1433,It hurt to watch this!
1434,1434,"Okay so that means if I don't understand a different language in a country I'm in that means I need to fear for my life? 

If he says no English than search him and try to understand him of try to give him instructions that he might understand if that doesn't work than just take him to the office and get someone who knows his language"
1435,1435,"“When you come to the US we expect you to follow our laws and speak our language.” How does that literal sense when there is basically no official language of the US. Also isn’t it a free country so you can express your own religion, so that can relate with language."
1436,1436,A pure act of racial discrimination
1437,1437,"“No English, no English!”

Uses that as an excuse to beat someone up."
1438,1438,US police are out of control
1439,1439,The true face of USA
1440,1440,When u expect the immigrant s to speak english according to law then why did u allow them .simple.if not allowed he couldn't have been paralyzed.
1441,1441,"Good thing this was recommended.
Now, when I will vist USA to meet some of my friends
I will be more caution."
1442,1442,"When you come to India we expect to you follow OUR laws and  
speak any of our 23 official languages or else you will be kicked out of our country."
1443,1443,That hurt me
1444,1444,US Police are nuts. Super aggressive and they always use the compliance excuse for their actions. How do you do that to an old man. There were two officers present.  Land of the free but you can't even walk down the street!
1445,1445,So because you lived 4 years in a neighborhood you know everyone who live there?
1446,1446,"Wanted to visit the US, now I've changed my mind. This is how Americans treats their visitors. Such a Shame."
1447,1447,I live in USA and my family lives outside USA one thing I will never bring my old people to come to USA and do the baby sitting for me or my children that’s shame
1448,1448,"I don't understand why Amerikkka don't feel shame... They are too proud, sad nation"
1449,1449,Are police sick?...  How come I hear so many such stories about police from the US behaving like this?   Perhaps the training that they go through is too aggressive?
1450,1450,This is so sad...
1451,1451,I'd expect nothing less from a U.S. officer
1452,1452,Wow... That is very bad.... Poor guy...
1453,1453,Wtf? Why push an old guy like this ever? I just feel like what if someone did that to my dad and paralyzed him. I would be horrified
1454,1454,Get well soon.
1455,1455,"If you're wondering, the cop ended up walking away free and returned to work."
1456,1456,The person who is narrating this video right from the beginning says the man was pushed that's bull crap I saw the video that officer almost picked him up and slam them to the ground.
1457,1457,"So is this a time when we say ""SWEET HOME ALABAMA"""
1458,1458,So happy i dont live in the us
1459,1459,2:58 no tourists allowed to travel to USA XD
1460,1460,"He is not responsible for what
Happened. Language has nothing
to do with this!!! Excessive
force was not needed!!!"
1461,1461,Yea didnt mean to hurt him when he tackled an old man with full force.. young officers man they dont know shit....
1462,1462,well I can feel how my fellow colored people day to day living in US while dealing with cops .
1463,1463,Eric is insane
1464,1464,I heard Alabama and I knew the answer
1465,1465,"This is an open an close case, why cant the jury come to ah verdit an be done with it everything is on camera"
1466,1466,How suddenly a footage frm 2015 pop up in my recommendation ..... someone is trying to devide India USA  relationship....not gonna happen
1467,1467,And how they treat other people in their country....imagine if same had happened in india ...to one of your country's men ....but our police isnt like that ....atleast they know humanity...
1468,1468,"It's disappointing
How can you do this to your guests
It is not at all tollerable"
1469,1469,See how they treat people different from them.
1470,1470,America has the weirdest laws in the name of self defence
1471,1471,America should change the law by cops can’t find false accusation for their mistakes
1472,1472,They didn't even show footage of the handkerchief falling out
1473,1473,"That cop is just a thug with a badge, nothing more and nothing less, I hope he gets put away."
1474,1474,Shame on USA and police for treating people like this because of their skin color and language.
1475,1475,"now i wanna know ,if all the police officer in US behave like this or few of them are good. bocoz this is my 4th vdo which show how ugly  US police is. also plz tell which state is safe bocoz i rly want to visit Las Vegas"

1477,1477,"Wow is this real? In USA!!!!
Warning: In the US we expect you to bring google translate with you if you dont know English otherwise you know what will happen!"
1478,1478,Good Home Alabama
1479,1479,Didn't expect this from a US police officer.
1480,1480,"WOW. What a fucked up Thesis to Sum up our justice Department. My god. Anybody know the status of the victim, has any apology been issued?"
1481,1481,"Hmm americans. Next time i will spot a white american whom i have never saw before in that area and dont speak hindi, will surely call cops🤓"
1482,1482,Wtf a old man walking on the road it's become safety issue of police ohh really they police ya some kind of drug dealers they don't have gun the issue was language ok fine you can arrest him but was the need of doing stupid things
1483,1483,Not-so-Sweet home Alabama
1484,1484,the Son is to blame !
1485,1485,😯
1486,1486,I don't understand why people are so hostile
1487,1487,Is this human rights that US always talk about it

1489,1489,So if you come to my country shall i or shall i not treat the same....this will be my Question '' tui ronda ase''  so sir do u speak my language?? Nope okey....the rest you know guys 😎😎😅

1492,1492,Wlc to police state 😂
1493,1493,It's a criminal act by the police...
1494,1494,Good!
1495,1495,So the fired cop meant that I can beat the crap out of an American person just cause he can't speak the native language. And that's gonna be very interesting.
1496,1496,"So innocent people get treated in this manner, he is a visitor for god sake!"
1497,1497,Arey Bhai Bhai bhai
1498,1498,Sue the living shit outa them.
1499,1499,There are a lot of Americans living in my city if Indian police does the same   there wouldn't be a single one of them alive.
1500,1500,May be some one will beat him ..wen he also become old
1501,1501,"@
bot in action
 mate there are plenty of Indian police officers and Indians in general who are above 6 feet lol. I personally know Indians who are 6 feet 4 and 6 feet 5 lol not many just two ppl but imagine how many there if I as one person already know two such ppl. If u have ever been to India u will notice many disparities in height among other things walk around around a crowded mall and u will see at least a 100 men over 6 foot lol. However that is missing the point it doesn't take much to take out a big dude with police weapons at ur disposal baton, tazers, sticks etc a couple of police officers in India or anywhere else for that matter could pretty much take anybody down."
1502,1502,"Another emergency phone call to the police says ""there's a black guy in my neighbourhood I've lived here for xxx years I've never seen him before."" So you know enough every single person lives on your street!?"
1503,1503,best tip ever never go to the usa
1504,1504,Aa gya mza USA jane ka
1505,1505,They kind of advertised this poorly. The United States doesnt have a police force. This was the Huntsville PD.
1506,1506,Just can't believe it a strong man can just tackle down an old man. Language is not a problem but be in your right sense is what matter. Come to Samoa and tackle me like that so that I can show a samoan tackle
1507,1507,United Stain on Humanity
1508,1508,Sue these Police Officers
1509,1509,Human Rights?
1510,1510,Yes that good
1511,1511,"US citizen not treat like this in india If they disobey the law or don't speak indian language , indian police don't treat like that .
Do US court accept if an indian police treatment their citizen like this,don't know language and don't know laws ?"
1512,1512,What the heck?!
1513,1513,"The  racist person who called should also be held financially responsible for medical bills on the chain reaction she or he started,  come on he does not look black, at least not to me, i lived in Texas all my life in the same house, i still dont know the people behind my house on the block behind me so what was their excuse for calling the police ?"
1514,1514,... He didn't do anything
1515,1515,Sad story but Some people hung up on language barrier thing as if there wiould have been better outcome if he was skinny Black man.
1516,1516,"😂, bring him back to india, make in India campaign. 
Says I dont know english in gujrati 😂.
Ofcourse you need to know english to visit US, 
And people are carefully ignoring what happened afterwards ""the cop was fired"" and the government treated him. "
1517,1517,There will be no reason what is it.
1518,1518,Indian in USA for not knowing English... lol.... Indian in one / two states of india itself bullied for not knowing Hindi.... This is called insecurity by any country or one two states in india.
1519,1519,"Send him to prison for life, where is trump now?"
1520,1520,If these kinds of incidents will happen in India 🇮🇳 then see the American news channel and human rights.
1521,1521,"this is the problem with 1st world countries, they have problems we couldn't even imagine of. I mean what threat did the caller face with that uncle"
1522,1522,"I think people need to realize that most of America isnt like this. The fact that you see so many Americans outraged about this proves that. Dont take the actions of one person and use it to judge a group of people.  If you do that then you are no better then the people you claim are shit. Dont generalize, as its wrong, just like hpw you are saying its wrong. Have a merry day."
1523,1523,"For me as an Indian, the real racist criminals here are that police officer and the person who called the cops on this poor innocent man"
1524,1524,Welcome to America
1525,1525,There is no official language in the United States
1526,1526,I expected nothing less from America
1527,1527,"So English is official language of usa, what about whites when they came native American spoke different language"
1528,1528,Police man needs to punished. He should be put behind the bar with big black men
1529,1529,Dis nt crrect.. i hurted wen they beated dat elder person .
1530,1530,"Black/brown..for them, all look the same..."
1531,1531,Alabama it is

1549,1549,@pewdiepie Help our Indian bro.
1550,1550,That PIG didnt push the Indian gentleman to the ground. He slammed him to the ground. Please report appropiately. I saw it and it was shocking and criminal.
1551,1551,Ya right. Hopefully  his now getting deported
1552,1552,Push that sweet sweet division. It's so yummy in my tummy.
1553,1553,He can’t even speak English. The police should respect.
1554,1554,the cop is team pewds
1555,1555,Come to India officer and let’s go 1 on 1 and then will see
1556,1556,Disgusting. That old man weighed less than 100lbs.
1557,1557,"Firstly, English is NOT the official language of USA for there is no official language in this country and English is just simply the most commonly spoken language. Also, it is total bosh to ask all tourists to speak English and understand the US law. I mean, seriously? So maybe the next step is to require everyone to be a lawyer and understand every single word in English( old and new) including all the regional slang?"
1558,1558,Arree english k bina kyu leke jaate ho America.
1559,1559,"That sucks ,when u go to another country.u white speak our neative language.."
1560,1560,F da police
1561,1561,"Us police wale ko India mai bhej do yaar koi.  Thoda bajrang dal,  thoda shivsena,  thoda BJP sab log ke paas."
1562,1562,"how stupid. the poor elderly man was not armed, only a handkerchief fell down and young officer pounced on that poor old man. the police officer needs some patience and common sense.. wow !! that too after the man said he did not know proper english. he was here to visit his little grandson, not to work in the United states. it is not a must that he should know english... !!"
1563,1563,And here I thought American law was better than india.our officers never take down any American tourists if an officer doesn't know English he'll call another for help.we don't do tomb stone pile-driver to our guests
1564,1564,Australia is a better place for this guy
1565,1565,Searching for bob and vegana haha
1566,1566,what if a mute guy is visiting America.?
1567,1567,Skinny black guy...smart country
1568,1568,"I am from a third world country as well (not india) and I would never visit to most of the first world countries for these issues. I know you guys don't care, in fact, a lot of you will be happy that people like me won't go to your country. But I just wanted to let you know... You guys are extremely racist towards us. That's not fair. That's not how a human should treat human. This Indian guy was a victim to it. I don't want to be that kind of victim. So no matter how much I want to, I will never go to a country like US. I will just stick by my shit-hole and die here. No one will notice, no one will care. But at least I will have my dignity."
1569,1569,"If he has to learn ""PROPER ENGLISH"" to not get his neck broken. White people should have to learn PROPER Hindi when in India."
1570,1570,All racists join the police as if all the Americans in the other parts of the world know how to speak their. languages.
1571,1571,"If any American visits India they should properly know Sanskrit as well as Hindi , otherwise they will face consequences like they do with ours .."
1572,1572,They were bunch of racist cops. They visit Indian and they are treated with royalty!
1573,1573,"My only hope, is that we understand crooked american police officers, do not represent all americans"
1574,1574,"Do not blame the officer, he thougt the old man was an isis."
1575,1575,"It's not just America, Europe, Asia  etc.. Racist are every where .. We can't do anything untill we change our mentality and that's  never gona happen boz we are Human Beings the most beautiful creation of God ."
1576,1576,Why are Americans like this?  What is wrong with them?  Why are they always suspicious of others?
1577,1577,Why cant they speak English
1578,1578,Indians stay in India
1579,1579,"By the same yardstick, if any US white visits India and doesn't speak any Indian language should get a similar treatment."
1580,1580,"poor man
God bless you
God will bring justice all the time"
1581,1581,Poor man😢
1582,1582,Hope you are recovering well mr p hope that cop was jailed.
1583,1583,I m sad for this old man
1584,1584,"for the reporter: police didn't pushed him on the ground, police slammed him on the ground........."
1585,1585,"These officers are very weak, I mean if this is how you handle an old man, then  I wonder what you do when you see a young man,!!! I am sure you will be calling a whole army to backup. This so disgusting!!!😖"
1586,1586,Here in the Netherlands i was arrested when i was nice to them. And the other time when they stopped me and i looked aggressive at them they let me go...
1587,1587,That is sickening. I think these cops watch too much WWE
1588,1588,You know this kind of racial behaviour will surely hamper Diplomatic relationship between the two nations.WTF?That grandpa was literally flying when the so called law enforcers took him down.Let me ask a question.What if the similar situation happens to any of the US old citizen in india?
1589,1589,When you come to india we expect you to follow our law and speak our language and btw we have plenty of them you can choose any .
1590,1590,"Wow two young cop, well trained strong muscular were threaten by an old man in his 60's having no weapons  this is United States of America world were cops says they are the law, and talk about human rights freedom of speech and so on, lets Make America Great again. Good luck by this attitude"
1591,1591,When you hear stop resisting ! you know shit bout to get real
1592,1592,Give up the charges. The firing alone should keep him out of law enforcement in the future.
1593,1593,"It sicken me how these so-called police officers special in United States feel that they can do whatever they want and they get away with it...

Personally they should have locked them up thrown in with the rest of the inmates.."
1594,1594,"Sad sad sad , ☹️"
1595,1595,I am also an Indian...when I was in UK some1 also called the cops coz they saw me around their house when I was doing a door to door job...the cops came to me and asked very nicely...These young officers in America are stupid...I wouldn't entirely blame them  though as the American culture made them like that...
1596,1596,"What the actual fuck? I’m so glad I live in the UK where police officers are kind and level-headed. This would never happen here! 

Nothing great about America LOL"
1597,1597,That was excessive. It was assault.
1598,1598,"I don't know, that quote from Robert Tuten sounds more like discrimination then sound reasoning."
1599,1599,"""You are expected to speak our language?"" Well by that logic India have 23 different language, you would get slammed like football every few kilometers. Happy traveling."
1600,1600,"Americans for very long time didn't see that older person may take morning walk on the street where he lives.  Whoa!
And this guy, policeman, most important is, that he took uniform of policeman, but doesn't have to think. Not his job description, he thinks. Whoa! His father should call him and at least slap him over face for embarrassing him."
1601,1601,Is there a US law according to which we have to be able to speak english if we come in the USA? What if we can't speak or hear? I  have been in a lot of countries accros the world and most of the time i couldn't speak their language.
1602,1602,It says lot about the jury
1603,1603,"i do understand cops motive was not bad 
but ...........poor man"
1604,1604,Two trials and no verdict..it can only happen in the US.this is the one of the reasons I will never visit..
1605,1605,"So, what was the outcome of this, seeing as how it was posted 4 years ago..?!"
1606,1606,He immediately looked @ the camera hoping he remembered to turn it off but to his chagrin we have it on tape.
1607,1607,How can someone call the cops just because someone is walking down the road
1608,1608,"Nonsense from that officer. When that officers parents came from Denmark I guess they couldn’t speak English too. Shame on you officer for your lack of humility, kindness and humanity...
Repent of your pride and give that man your apologies.
Lord Jesus Christ forgive him for he truly don’t know you..."
1609,1609,The cop was in the right
1610,1610,Did not expect that from the police
1611,1611,You need to sue the government for $1 billion this is going to open their eyes not to harass people
1612,1612,"This is way sad, using that much force on frail built man just shows he was over ambitious and perhaps trigger happy......who knows"
1613,1613,I swear i will so the same to an American if you dont speak fluent hindi when you come to Delhi! He clearly said INDIAN
1614,1614,"Innocent people will always be the victims....I will not curse whole US for this, but surely some of them are very insensitive."
1615,1615,So sad
1616,1616,"*This is America 
Don't catch you slippin' up 
Look at how I'm livin' now
Police be trippin' now*"
1617,1617,Wow being black  when walking 🚶 hurts once in a while .
1618,1618,"So what law was he breaking, that you had to break his neck? 
Excessive force was used, I wouldn't have any problem putting this guy in jail."
1619,1619,The neighbor is to blame for...
1620,1620,That was bullshit! Excessive use of force!!
1621,1621,Cops are too viloent. And we get told off for using aggresive force. But for this cop he was fired.
1622,1622,Sweet home Alabama. 😂
1623,1623,As an Nepali person I hate how they treated him to the man I know English
1624,1624,"The caller stated that a ""Black man"" was walking around in the neighborhood looking suspicous."
1625,1625,What law did he violate? He was just having a morning walk. I am sure he is not the only person who doesn't understand English across the United States. If they slam somebody down for not being able to understand English then i suppose Americans tourists should also get treated the same way in India for not being able to understand Indian languages.
1626,1626,"Welcome to the comment section. It has...
Legitimate concern regarding police brutality: 10%
Literally an anti-American statement: 90%"
1627,1627,"He didn’t want to hurt, just slightly break his neck. 
When you go to USA make sure learn American language. When they come to yours, they will speak English."
1628,1628,So when Americans go to other countries they should speak there languages also ....or the same will happen ....the officer should get done for it and sued
1629,1629,Since when not speaking English has become crime
1630,1630,That pig needs jail time.  I hope I can meet him one day
1631,1631,🤣🤣🤣🤣
1632,1632,What an absolute disgrace the US police force are.
1633,1633,"This is those old school bullies, they spot a weak, old, skinny person, and to be manly, and to show their power they slammed him, they should know this is not manly but cowardly, you don't have balls to fight with person of your strength."
1634,1634,He was called on only because he was in the neighborhood.
1635,1635,What did Mr Patel do?
1636,1636,"What the fuck was that, man 
With so much cruelty he threw that old man.."
1637,1637,"So I guess a cop causing possible permanent damage to an individual is okay then? Merica....

You don't NEED to speak English to be in this country, but I guess anything can be a reason to hurt someone now-a-days. I also hope the caller that caused all of this, feels like shit for possibly ruining someone's life."
1638,1638,That was sick I hate cops like that they almost killed him wow 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡he needs to go to jail after what he did

1643,1643,So if come as a traveler for a vacation from any non English speaking country it's my fault for not speaking the language. mhhm... Interesting fact
1644,1644,Why????? These guys sit around and wait for action turning into a pack of wolves.
1645,1645,that official better learn all the languages. because went he goes to jail he will need it🤣
1646,1646,I’ll volunteer to take down this cop!
1647,1647,Well at least he was fired. Hopefully he’ll never work in law enforcement again and this example will be used as a training tool.
1648,1648,Officer safety my ass
1649,1649,"If the person couldn't speak English, why not get a translator? He mentioned the house number, is that not enough to get hold of someone for the required information? Inhumane!"
1650,1650,I think the American Police should attend workshop on Behaviour from the Indian Police
1651,1651,They should sue
1652,1652,If you don’t speak English in America expect to be paralyzed for it
1653,1653,Did you not mean First Nations person or Aboriginal
1654,1654,The officer should be charged for voluntary attempt to murder

Most of the Americans don't have any manners how to behave with the people from other countries. They think that they are superiors. May god will teach you a leason."
1705,1705,“Skinny black guy” hmmmm
1706,1706,"Mr policeman said he didn't mean to hurt Mr. Patel, just break his neck because no hables English"

1711,1711,That fired officer looks like a punk. They should sue.
1712,1712,An absolute disgrace the way American police act.....     shocking.
1713,1713,Wtf???he was cooperating n unarmed but why???brainless police distroy his life...
1714,1714,Very sad. No need to harass an unarmed pedestrian! English is not even an official language of this country.
1715,1715,Why are people condemning all Americans or all the police force for the actions of 1 person? Please explain that one to me ....... I'm waiting
1716,1716,"This kind of act is very wrong.
It is not about Indian, korean or anyone else.
Police of any state either US or anyother country must be trained better to how to deal with people.
Otherwise Innocents will be facing problems like this only."
1717,1717,Do Americans learn Hindi before they go and visit India?
1718,1718,"If a skinny, unarmed, 50+ indian fellow scares the shit out of 2 young, well built, heavily armed and trained police officers, they need to go to McDonald's and flip burgers. Let someone little less coward take care of the police duty,."
1719,1719,it's well said America is a free country and yet you will be taken down like a sheep if you walk free there.

1721,1721,A.c.a.b.
1722,1722,"Just f***inf rediculous. Someone calls the police because they were walking on the pavement/sidewalk located in front of their house. Really!!!! It's not your f***ing drive. Do the elderly not take walks in the neighbourhood where a park is very far from where they live in the US. Asian people like to take a stroll in their neighbourhood, same for people in the UK. I don't know how the US law works only he sidewalk/payment in front of a resident's house, but in the UK the law states that the pavement/sidewalk is for PUBLIC use and is not land owned by the property is behind it or anywhere next to or near it. We're be never had such an incident like the above, but incidents involving strangers parking on the pavement/sidewalk in front of resident's houses is a problem and the council just dismisses it because of the law."
1723,1723,"So ur saying that people should be deported because they can’t speak English. More than 20 percent of U.S. residents speak a language other than English at home. More than one in five people living in America speaks a language other than English at home, while more than one in 10 speaks Spanish, according to the latest United States Census Bureau American Community Survey."
1724,1724,Poor man. Paralysed because a lady spotted a black person walking.
1725,1725,English =England
1726,1726,He was scared of a old Indian man maybe being a police officer shouldn’t be his job
1727,1727,"Americans get yourself a lil bit educated:-
Why Indians go to America and get settled? Because you people give us jobs and pay us less than what you normally pay to your own citizens. Still we work even earn more than Americans and tries to get settled with our families. We pay tax, we ain't living for free. We generate more expenditure in your country. Our families come here get settled, which are ultimately, increasing the our family expenditure. What you can peruse from above facts is that we ain't living for free, we aren't a refuge. We work are asses off and earn what we deserve. We pay income tax and indirect taxes on the goods we consume. We suffer unequal pay but still don't complain. We also come to study in your great luminous Universities, not because we want but also because they accept foreign students. We pay them and learn for ourselves. We come from a very pious and culturally rich country and we are least troubling. Now, especially white people who are always being racist shall be clear on the fact that you all yourself are intruders, you are descendants of Englishmen. You intruded into the lands of the Red Indian Tribes. This country cannot be genuinely claimed by white people so please respect every culture and try to be more secular and a sweetheart towards every religion. We aren't eating your jobs, if we are blame your govt. Who let's us in than not troubling us."
1728,1728,I don't know why but everyone wants to beat Indians. #thingaboutit.
1729,1729,Maybe he shouldn't have squatted down and shit on the street in front of them. Culture clash.
1730,1730,scam vs scam and racist vs racist
1731,1731,oh jesus christ is this is your religion that punish innocent😢😢😢😢😢
1732,1732,Americans.
1733,1733,Americans should be ashamed of themselves.
1734,1734,Sounds about white ...
1735,1735,"Hmm it's bad but the govt acted against the culprit cop. But in India Muslims and hindu dalits are getting lynched to death for  keeping or eating beef , it happened not once or twice but many many times and still happening. India is democratic  secular country where one can eat whatever he wish, but that not the case in many part of the country nowadays. Innocent people should not be attacked in any country."
1736,1736,Most of the americans is probably scared of cops
1737,1737,America is hell.......
1738,1738,Let's gave you example if this America go to India he     he have to speak hindi if no people shut bet him like dog I'm not Indian but I  the low
1739,1739,Give him foodstam
1740,1740,"2:56 the lawyer for the cop is being unreasonable. No law was broken by walking on the sidewalk. 

A grandfather is unlikely to learn good English; there is NO EXCUSE for police to use excessive force in a clearly non-violent situation (!!!)"
1741,1741,"Lol!!! Americans are really brave.... Keep up with your bravery, Americans 👍👍"
1742,1742,My Heart Dropped
1743,1743,"When you come to India we expect you to follow our laws and speak our language in whatever state you go following by their different languages. Otherwise he/she bears as much responsibility. 

But keep calm, we don't need to do that."
1744,1744,After seeing the video of the incident i am strangly happy that the cop got fired. And why would you slam an old man like that?
1745,1745,Shame on USA !
1746,1746,I'm happy he's fired. I hope he visits India someday. We'd show him our hospitality and not hostility that he reflected to our fellow grandpa.
1747,1747,You are welcomed to INDIA!🤛🏻🤜🏻
1748,1748,"that just pre-meditated, you can hear the cop say ""hes trying to get away from me"", thats just a lie to cover up his assault, you can see him ready up to take down that guy, he places his left leg in front of the guy, springs to generate force, then swings his leg back to flip his feet up, that is not something you do as a knee jerk reaction, thats all pre meditated"
1749,1749,"when the old man don't have any thing suspicious, why to do that?"
1750,1750,Lmao right when she said Alabama I was done
1751,1751,"Barbaric acts, God bless him"
1752,1752,"Now think about the abuse of power by Moodi in
 Kashmir. I feel sorry for your Dad.  We are all human beings, and we feel the same way when we are hurt."
1753,1753,I guess breaking his neck make them really strong man
1754,1754,The officer was so damn threatened that  he had to break the neck of a Skinny and innocent old man
1755,1755,He should ask for compensation from the cop
1756,1756,After Watching this video i concluded to myself that the Earth is no longer to be  safe. This incident is just a tip of an iceberg. Atleast he had fired but in india we cannot expect that much justice also. me being an indian got arrested by standing few meters away from my bike in drink n drive case
1757,1757,He deserves the decision
1758,1758,Abuse of power !
1759,1759,Well that was straight up assault.
1760,1760,Why are US cops so itchy to hurt someone? 😂
1761,1761,Mr Parker went to jail. He became very good friend with Tyron
1762,1762,"Also look up 'American man fighting with Indian police'.
I don't know hindi so I can't tell what the situation was about though. Jai Hind"
1763,1763,That police man is fired from the job. Ok 👍
1764,1764,In US I've see a kid calling cops just to do his homework
1765,1765,Wait did they do that to that man.... if somebody do that to my father i will go after his family i bet you.
1766,1766,no law suit??
1767,1767,Did you sue the city police department???
1768,1768,Well actually this was a very professional search by the police ....
1769,1769,Giving too much of rights to POLICE would be a natural outcome of such misadventures.
1770,1770,Coward cop!  Picking on an old defenseless man!  Lock him up!!!
1771,1771,Welcome to America! Tha land of the free😂😂😂😂😂😂
1772,1772,How can cops hurt an old man and get away with it. Why don't you do something about the police oppression there?
1773,1773,the land of great sins...
1774,1774,In The land of the 'brave' lives tiny cowards peeping from their windows and sight of  skinny strangers makes them pee.
1775,1775,When the old man said India. He knows that he can do anything to the old man so he pulled him. He knows that no one will ask him any questions because we are indian.🙁🙁🇮🇳. Pray to God that you never come to india by any Chance
1776,1776,Well if he struggled to speak English why his children let him go out alone walking? I srsly pity the old man tho
1777,1777,"But one thing i admit before going to any place u should at least learn their language not all of it but just basic , thts one thing but that rage is not yet justifying ....... Americans no grung against u luv from India"

That man was 5.8 in height very skinny in the age of 55 to 60, is there any necessary to strike him that hard to ground.. he was not carrying any gun, knife etc.. 
I was always against ""BLACK LIFE MATTERS"" but now I'm considering.."
1785,1785,HE WAS WALKING !!! WTF ???
1786,1786,"Except feeling sad for the man the Indians and Americans are fighting each other and people from other countries are joining too, how shameful ! You can fight ,fighting is easy but making a good relationship is very hard, 😡😡😡"
1787,1787,So in the words of robert tuten i will also say ..  if you come to our country learn to speak all our languages and follow our rules or else we will also pound you to the ground ! Peace ✌️

1793,1793,What a nation of human rights. The nation who dictates other nations about human rights doesn't have basic rights.
1794,1794,Excessive force seems to be an American police culture
1795,1795,You know what... why are there calls for people walking on sidewalks? And no one ever calls for people actually lurking around peoples homes?
1796,1796,he knew the guy didn't understand him!
1797,1797,Police vs old man? Is it so hard not to force the old man stay on the ground? It's looks stupid assaulted old man like that..
1798,1798,I have seen us police  officers have lot of attitude.
1799,1799,200 dislike I guess there is more 199 police officers like him left
1800,1800,This is disgrace to the whole US police department. They should request an officer who could speak Gujrati. And the person who reported this gentleman is an idiot. This incident will put US citizens on risk in the world especially the defence lawyer's statement.
1801,1801,"I just want to say one thing to my fellow Indians here. What this man did is appalling and devastating. And yes, it is not uncommon in some parts of the US. But let us not take cheap shots at the whole nation and resort to pettiness. You will find a lot of racist, inconsiderate comments below. You might feel tempted to reply, and start a useless argument, but I urge you to control your anger, and not reply but report such racist comments. Not just here, but anywhere on YouTube you see racist comments. Don't reply, just report. A lot of our loved ones reside in the US and have lived there safely for years, right? It's because there are a lot of good people in America. It's just that YouTube tends to attract the scum. Let us not act like scum too."
1802,1802,I’m going for a walk
1803,1803,Are US citizen asulted in India for not speaking Hindi .shame on US law system who could not give proper justice to an old man
1804,1804,BRAIN DRAIN

1809,1809,This s sad
1810,1810,American culture.... Wild wild west.... If d cops do this with all their trainings.... What can u expect from the common American public?
1811,1811,Eric Parker... Is he a typical alabama good ol boy??? I understand that Mr. Patel does not speak english but that is no excuse!!! He was a defenseless man who in the video is not posing any harm nor does it seem that he is trying to escape! As for the federal grand jury... They must be good ol boys too to justify B.S. !!!
1812,1812,What the hell you don't feel angry ridiculous I'd sue the Huntsville Police Department for a hundred million dollars the only thing they understand if you take it out of the pockets
1813,1813,He wasn't even resisting the police and you can just see how he just smacked him to the ground and yet the police officer was saying that he didn't mean to hurt him. I mean wtf dude...
1814,1814,This why we called Mother Country is Heaven..................
1815,1815,What the hell shame on us police.is this way to treat people from other countries.
1816,1816,So if I want to visit 10 countries should I spend 10 years on languages classes or what. .? Just rubbish rules .I am not sure if that rule actually exist. I think this person is cooking it up. If it does exist show me the page numbers in which the constitution says so .
1817,1817,They will try him for the third time and set him free
1818,1818,That’s America for u.I know India also has many flaws but no one on earth would do this in India.Shame on you cops.Even the African Americans have complained.
1819,1819,"When American police came lie down keep your hand in back and speak one sentence I have right to be silence, let them arrest you ... call your lawyer let your lawyer talk to them after few hours they released you come home take rest next morning do the same... in this way you won't get seriously injured or get killed by accident.... after several arrest sue the police department all the police know you they won't come to arrest you anymore...

1820,1820,"I thought Americans respect Indians, ty Americans for your wonderful gift of welcoming Indians this way. Shame on Americans. Shame on you Mr Parker he is old, why would you use such a force with an innocent person, shame on you Mr Parker.."
1821,1821,His defence council need a good beating.
1822,1822,joyu! America ma su halat thay 6! India ma koi American ne police aavu kare to police wado  sidho jail ma j jay. bharat ma politician ma kai dam nathi atle.
1823,1823,"Didn't mean to hurt mr. Patel
Body slam mr. Patel"
1824,1824,why the fuck would they knock down a middle-aged man like that for NO REASON??
1825,1825,This is absolute crap ! Its okay to call 911 but the police officer didnt maintain the code of conduct . I would have sued him in the highest court & took this to the national level hurting the US tourism economy ! Whatever man i will abide by the law strictly & take stringent actions against anyone who violates the law ! There will be a nation wide outrage ! Laws are laws ! Doesnt matter if its US or UK or India cuz im a globalist & not a jingoistic person ! We grow through trade & merging ! We get divided by being jingoistic & the result is brexit which everyone can see ! I didnt had any problem trading with any nations i mingle with them quickly . For i dont see them from a perspective of american or indian or chinese instead i focus on objectives & something called humanity ! We are homosapiens & that's our identity ! God created lands but didnt divide its we who did all the modifications & started dividing each other !
1826,1826,"Wait, did she just say Gujrat, INDIA?! It's in Pakistan!!!"
1827,1827,They hired to many bullies on tho police forces somebody will break his  neck or beat bad one day or someone close to him
1828,1828,What's the language that you speak .... GUNS !!!!... that's so SAD.
1829,1829,"I've have friends who happen to be American, but I've never encountered such racist comments ever in my life in this comment section. Extreme use of force is a known problem in the U.S. If y'all really call yourself ""civilised"" , why is this issue still not solved again ?"
1830,1830,Long term karma
1831,1831,police officer should know he was harmless man walking alone. he should have used softer approach. police man should be fined imprisoned excessive force.
1832,1832,"When an American come to India then they should speak Hindi and comply with our laws then, or else what ? Complete injustice and abuse of authority!"
1833,1833,Wtf is wrong with the US cops??
1834,1834,Protected hate is very dangerous because protectors are complicit the jury itself should be tried for hate
1835,1835,Yes Mr( Pork)was interested to hurt Mr Patel shame on that us police officer Mr ( pork).
1836,1836,"So LOGICALLY SPEAKING according to what the defense attorny said, India has 23 recognized languages according to our law in 23 different states of the country ,so unless u dont know these 23 languages get ready to be beaten up 23 different times in 23 different states by 23 different people 😑*facepalm*"
1837,1837,"If i discover any American cop in my indian soil, poor fellow is gonna regret his vacation"
1838,1838,Im sure not a dame thing happend to the cops
1839,1839,"Move to another State...the officer will be rehired..wanna bet? He should have been in jail for no less than 5 years for assault, big monetary fine and never ever be in law enforcement jobs anymore."
1840,1840,"This cop should be in Prison and never be a Police officer again , I am Pro Police but this is way over the line"
1841,1841,"hating dislike chosen this path by police, so charge of discrimination also."
1842,1842,Welcome to America!
1843,1843,Those officers didnt have a phone. They could have simply used Google translator.
1844,1844,Doesnt speak english?? So you kill him???
1845,1845,"So if American visiting India must know almost every language in every state he visits or else they'll end up in hospital, it that ok?
If anybody (Police) asks why you are walking here what you'll say?
Whatever you say if they consider that as a lie, then what you'll do?"
1846,1846,That man was simply walking down the street not doing a single thing. If that had been my father and they did that to him I swear to God I may be killed but I will go after that cop and I will try to put a hurting on him that would last the rest of his life. There was no excuse for what that cop did he was wrong wrong wrong wrong! This kind of behavior needs to Stop & Stop now there is no excuse!!
1847,1847,2:04
1848,1848,"'Us citizen goes to another country'
Us: hello
The world:he speak english arrest him"
1849,1849,"Good Luck with visiting India
they have thousand languages"
1850,1850,Does that surprise you? I've seen that every day for 20 yrs.
1851,1851,Discrimination and false arrest plus Battery
1852,1852,"I hope those white people who called the cops on him get what's coming to them. In this life, or the next."
1853,1853,Hey if u dont speak english so wat ?? What crime did he commit ?? So that he has to use the force to break his neck !!
1854,1854,The caller call 911 and said it's a black guy wow
1855,1855,Why are USA cops so over aggressive and go quickly for their guns.
1856,1856,"He went from India to the US "" to help look after his grandson""
Mmmm.......
That's a new one. It's usually a single male gaining entry and then suddenly discovering his wife and young family , that were ""overlooked""."
1857,1857,Wow so we can’t take a walk in the US. I will not go there.
1858,1858,Not sweet home alabama.
1859,1859,"This is not good,  common he was an old man,  not criminal,  if somebody does not speak English,  does not man is bad,  what if people go to different country and treat like this,  cos of language"
1860,1860,Obey laws ??? speak your language . . . .  without getting interpreter you snap a neck . . . that was a rugby move . . . . could be tourist . visitor . . .the person that called the police is an arse . . . .
1861,1861,In that case india should expect US citizen to speak Hindi in they are ever been to india .
1862,1862,😡😡
1863,1863,Pushed? Wtf more like slammed
1864,1864,At least the officer lost his job and charged a 3rd degree felony. If this  happened in India the same justice  wouldnt be served
1865,1865,"India are very polite and they respect their elder very much.
But most of the Americans are very rude and they don't show any respect towards elder ones. shame on you guys"
1866,1866,WTF? Are you goofy?
1867,1867,"Officers safety? from a 58yr old fragile man? wtf...what happened to common sense? if that man was saying 148 they could've taken him. And whoever called up the police, seriously how paranoid can you get? you could've simply followed the guy to his home."
1868,1868,"If it was a old skinny white guy she'd never seen before, I can guarantee u he could walk up and down those streets for a year and she wouldn't even call the Cops."
1869,1869,What kind of a morn will say that Mr Patel is responsible as he is expected to talk English. If you come to India you learn Indian language???
1870,1870,പോലീസുകാരന്റെ കരണകുറ്റി അടിച്ചു പൊളിക്കാൻ തോന്നുന്ന മലയാളികൾ അടി ലൈക്ക് ..
1871,1871,Hey! American I thought you're civilized.
1872,1872,I wanted to visit the US but now meh.
1873,1873,He doesn't even know hindi . Wow a disgrace
1874,1874,Why US police always react like that is they think everyone is terrorist
1875,1875,So if I find an American guy not speaking Hindi perfectly be prepared to get dirt in the mouth.
1876,1876,He was not pushed...he was slammed!!! Damn you there was a difference.
1877,1877,why does this happen.  does the usa not know how to hirer police officers there are so many videos that cops think they are above the law and the justice system let them get away with this.  This is not racist they do this to all types of people
1878,1878,Sue!
1879,1879,The neighbor should be held accountable tge 9-1-1 caller with there false report
1880,1880,Its pathetic
1881,1881,99% of police in usa or anywhere else - are not like this b.stard  officer. good they fired him . but poor mr patel still has to recover from this
1882,1882,I think people missed it or not mention this. But the old guy said he dropped his handkerchief and was trying to pick it up. That's also when the officer looked away for a second. The officer felt him moving and thought maybe he's taking out a gun and then slammed him down. It's a bad judgment call and a bad coincidence. I'm pretty sure he didn't do it cuz the guy didn't speak the language. Like come on people. Not saying I support what he did. But it's just too many things going wrong . Maybe he could have done it more gently. Maybe even if he did it with force the guy wouldn't be paralysed and it wouldn't be such a big case. So stop commenting. He slammed him for not speaking the language or cuz he was dark skinned. Atleast in this case
1883,1883,Is this is de way to behave wi8 some1... Don't dare 2 come India wi8out learning proper Hindi...
1884,1884,If  u cant speak local lang dis is bad
1885,1885,White boy on a power trip
1886,1886,It takes only one or two racist jurors to avoid or prevent a guilty verdict and conviction.
1887,1887,This is very disturbing and shameful for the police. Why were they scared of a weak 60 year old?
1888,1888,Police force in America is out of control I think citizens should ban together when police are around and if nessasery show the police how it feels to be beaten by overwhelmeing numbers
1889,1889,SUE THEM FOR $$ MILLIONS...YOU WILL WIN ...IF WAS MY FATHER ...THIS COP WOULD HAVE TO BE INVISIBLE..
1890,1890,Disgusting. That cop and his partner should be in jail. I wonder how many other innocent people he has done that to and got away with. He deserves to go to jail and get bullied everyday
1891,1891,Not even surprised
1892,1892,Follow laws yes........speak the language not necessary in America......its not constitutionally mandated.....give an answer- again not needed. The police shd have called a translator - he did say India....that's enough to find a translator.
1893,1893,Ok people let's not get crazy ok. Yes those cops deserve to be fired and jailed both of them. Their attorney should be disbarred for using such foul racist verbiage. That being said you can not paint all Officers with the same broad brush. There are good and bad ones like in every profession. It's up to each Department to pick and choose the best and root out the bad ones. The Chiefs and Commanders Sgts.  Etc..also need to be held accountable for their subordinates behavior on duty..Yes this is a terrible thing that happened this man.There is no excuse..But do not paint all Officers to be the same. They are not..Thousands of officers have died all over the country doing their job. I agree the bad ones need to go and be punished accordingly. This stuff happens all over the world and every department has to deal with bad police officers..This incident was very tragic and I hope he recovers and the officers are punished. But to go to the  extreme and label all officers as bad is not right and only perpetuates bad stereotypes.
1894,1894,"Disgusting excuse: The us has no official language, and he certainly broke no laws. Apparently to that cop slamming someone on the grass or pavement is so normal that he has a hard time understanding."
1895,1895,So not knowing language is crime in US so what if all countries in the world follow the same... How many Americans are living in non English speaking countries...?
1896,1896,Trump went to russia and korea he doeasnt speak either language hmmmm
1897,1897,Racism
1898,1898,sue sue sue money money money
1899,1899,Make sure you bloody American speak hindi... When go to our country.... What a shame!!!
1900,1900,Having a walk in a country where people drive two houses down the street is suspicious.
1901,1901,Absolutely shocking so sorry for what happened to you
1902,1902,Wow... The defence lawyer literally said that? Damn that makes me sick.
1903,1903,"That move was so painful to watch, shouldn't they be more professional"
1904,1904,THAT'S THE BEST STATEMENT THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY CAME UP WITH? CRIMINALS ARE DOOMED FOR FAILURE!
1905,1905,"3:01

""When you come to the US we expect you to follow our laws and speak our language."""
1906,1906,"when you come to US follow our laws I wonder which law was mr patel was breaking?? 
Is it walking in the side walk????"
1907,1907,Sometimes I just don’t know how I feel being American....
1908,1908,"Yo, that cop looked like he was waiting for this very moment to use his special move"
1909,1909,"How just people behave like this 
Yes hurt watching this 
But uncle is still having amazing response he's not angry 
I want to be tolerant like that !!"
1910,1910,What is wrong with police officers?...why use such brutal force all the time?...I feel so bad for this man
1911,1911,"""Refused to comply with the request"" in a language he didn't understand?! How in the world will he get what the cop was saying US jury??!! And which law did he break again?"
1912,1912,Never mess with an innocent Indian.
1913,1913,HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED.
1914,1914,"M indian, bt d things which was showed in dis video was insane, use of such force for an old man by a cop!!! Shame man!!!! But it does nt define all cops r same!!!"
1915,1915,Ridiculous!! Look at the age of the elderly. Shame on the officer who seem to have forgotten the values!!
1916,1916,"bruh if that man was one of my relatives, someones dying!"
1917,1917,You know what sad about this that the fact cops got smart phones and couldnt use google translate it would been a world of difference
1918,1918,I love you America
1919,1919,"What the caller really meant was "" I've lived here for 4 years And never seen a black person before""."
1920,1920,"Weird, when visiting another country, it's important to respect & follow its law, but to, compulsory, speak their language, come on...what nonsense is that?"
1921,1921,There is no law that says you have to speak English land of the free remember it's just the primary language
1922,1922,Shameful. Only the “free and brave” can do this...
1923,1923,That cop is cold why the heck they reacted wild i mean the old man didn't have weapons or tryin to run away the old man is patience
1924,1924,he tried to keep walking though... twice
1925,1925,"Whole conclusion i can draw from this incident is if you dont know English then American police will break your neck,,,,wow"
1926,1926,"Wow, what a brave American cop arrested 54 year  dangerous old man and break his neck. He deserves bravery awards. He save USA from disaster."
1927,1927,WTF 2:51 officer safety interest!  It's clear brutality... He should be published..
1928,1928,NRI should be treated like that only...Well done!
1929,1929,"What is the attorney talking about, did he break the law? He was just walking there. And the police officer who threw him on the ground deserve prison for sure."
1930,1930,"Hi defence lawyers states he should of followed the law and speak English ...... what law did he break, and if he does not speak English is that breaking the law. This is disgusting and the police are sick for hiring this guy back clearly he used necessary force for no reason."
1931,1931,"2 young police officers and this is what you do to a ""skinny"" old man?"
1932,1932,"Only when he is on the floor, he suddenly goes ....stop trying to jerk away from me. He did that to cover his back, the jury made a big mistake. Where is the justice, its not fair."
1933,1933,"Pissed off on that lady to call 911 for a brown person to walk by her neighbourhood. And for god sakes, the police man! ,  you should be ashamed to allegedly harm an innocent man without any backdrop evidence of suspicious activity. That's not what you're supposed to do. If you were in India we are pleased to welcome you to our country. And this is what we get. Shame."
1934,1934,Thanks for sharing .. Way to treat a  foreigner/Tourist  ?? Looking by his age officer could have made a decision on need of abusive force. Unfortunate Justice is based on cast/Creed/color.. Welcome to Trump's America.
1935,1935,You break someone's neck because they don't speak your language and you have the shamelessness to justify that?
1936,1936,What was his family thinking letting a man who doesn't speak the language out for walking ?
1937,1937,"I went to France last October. i’m very thankful that they didn’t break my neck, I don’t speak French though"
1938,1938,Coward throws an old man to the ground.....
1939,1939,This is just messed up
1940,1940,Honestly this is half of the callers fault.
1941,1941,"So you are new to the neighborhood? 
But have you gotten the local welcome greetings of half paralysis?"
1942,1942,Thats so sad
1943,1943,"so no one should visit another country unless they speak the language?
yep because that makes sense.
not suprised that the officer was let off twice !"
1944,1944,"""Skinny black guy"" i think we'll need the whole army out there"
1945,1945,Roid Rage? (Steroids are used by some cops to bulk up).
1946,1946,"I would like to request all indians, to give back the same treatment in return to american guys in india."
1947,1947,I know hate begets hate but I can't control emotions after seeing this attitude.... He should be sent to prison
1948,1948,how can they ?
1949,1949,very shameful act...
1950,1950,The officer seems to have highly inspired by action movies....trying on old people..
1951,1951,It is OK to report a stranger walking on street but the unlucky guy met wrong Cop
1952,1952,More frightening is the fact that two juries did not find the cop guilty..a sad reflection of current American society??
1953,1953,if I do it to some one who doesn't speak our native language I will be the one in jail
1954,1954,Dont do this Innocents we r all humen being one day or another we have to leave this Earth and we have to give explanation to God what we did when we were alaive
1955,1955,what brought that guy to break his neck ?
1956,1956,"That’s so upsetting. Thank God he didn’t say ‘Muslim’, he would’ve been shot dead and that my friend would have been ‘self-defence’."
1957,1957,Last time I checked you had the right to speak whatever language you wanted to....
1958,1958,The should sue the city for millions.
1959,1959,Vunerable old man is a threat.
1960,1960,Stay in ur country nd try helping ppl change ur country running away to other countries will result in this.u cannot expect things from another nation so try being in india
1961,1961,"home of the brave, land of the free. take a walk inn the worng neighbour u might get shot down"
1962,1962,These are not true oath keepers they should all be fired
1963,1963,Only in the USA is going for a walk seen as weird.
1964,1964,What the hell? What is this logic that you have to know how to speak English when you come to the US
1965,1965,This is scary
1966,1966,That cop that did this is 27 years old must played too many videos game and want to do it real life take the law into his own hands and play the victim wheres this protect and serve the public bullshit
1967,1967,..... no words because if I do someone will attack me religiously
1968,1968,you can pardon Mr.Parker..he was just ignorant..
1969,1969,Indians should apply the same laws in India too except for the purpose of bussiness we will not entertain any foriegn language.
1970,1970,"You don't speak English, you shouldn't come the US!. What kind of an argument is that. If he travels to a country and cannot communicate in the native language, will he accept it with a pleasant face and blame himself that it only happened because he could speak in that language?!!"
1971,1971,Man this always happens in the us because these people because of being developed are crippling their abilities i have seen a lot of them just not climbing ladders fearing tetnus and this also in moral values these people are over protective and call cops on even a kids fight thats what happens when police is available on just a phone call its overused these police guys should have tried to speak ro his son cause these pwople who come to take care for thier children are not there for work and may or may not know their language
1972,1972,They do that daily
1973,1973,Racist freaks! What was the need to slam him like that! And the complaint made was so silly! So they don’t expect to see new people there?  Such a disgrace!
1974,1974,Wtf kind off search did that guy try to do???
1975,1975,where is the Human rights of america???

1993,1993,#AMERICAISGREAT🤣
1994,1994,"What was the police officer thinking while smashing the old guy .  I see no reason for it because they have already searched the person found nothing. That's the problem with so called ""more overly greatly developed nations"" so we as humans shouldn't act like this . Should some responsibility towards other's because they also have feeling's. In end overly excess freedom for every small things is dangerous."
1995,1995,even he is not able to talk English but this is humanity to put down some elderly he is so weak that he could die...does officer doesn't see that ...does he also treat a white non English speakers who is about mr Patel's age I don't think so
1996,1996,And no one asked why the son sounds like APU?
1997,1997,If that's the reason then every tourist in India from another country would go home half paralysed too if they didn't speak Hindi .What an excuse lawyer
1998,1998,"The fuck is wrong with law enforcement in this country! And explain me this, how corrupt is the law enforcement tangled into the judiciary system, that the jury fails to come to a decision??? That those who are to serve and protect are committing the crimes, and the least happens is they get fired??"

2002,2002,Bla bla this is Real America ? 😢👍
2003,2003,Not making lite. But the Indian government has room to demand anything. Their departments have done worse. Now. The jury has to decide if the officer used excessive force. From my point of view. I haven't seen the whole vid. Or the corresponding vid from the other car.
2004,2004,Any police and army fans here?
2005,2005,Alabama ..... of course
2006,2006,"Why no one is talking about that stupid neighbor?
So why does it matter if there's someone new just passing by your house? Hundreds of people (Who I've never seen before) pass by my house every single day, I don't start calling police every time!"
2007,2007,Police behave like he carried illegal gun . shame.
2008,2008,Man due respect that cop shouldn't come to India after this because people aren't happy about him Indians know what I mean#mob lynching I guess
2009,2009,Why is he in other people driveways? And why dont he speak English?
2010,2010,"This is America...! Shame on such racist citizens who call police saying a ""skinny black guy"" is walking around. And shame on such police who uses force on an old man who is not even half his size. Trust me in India we would never behave in such a way with a foreign national as Citizens or police officers."

2019,2019,Only if the snowflake neighbor would have went out and ask the old man who he is other then calling cops on a person out for a walk... Many lawsuits would have been avoided... This kinda shit happens when you allow people to cocoon in their SAFESPLACE..
2020,2020,We Indian people 😘giving them too much respect.... When any American come to India we should ask them in hindi.... If they can't speak than break their neck and teeth🤣

2057,2057,"A classic case of self realization for Indians, we ourselves are racist towards each other, but look at all my fellow countrymen crying foul in the comment section, this could very easily happen to an Indian from north east in Delhi, to a Bihari in Mumbai, NE guys are looked down upon in other states, 400 Bihari workers killed in Assam, a UP guy killed in Mumbai, Biharis told to leave Gujrat, NE people told to leave karnataka so stop crying foul in other countries, maar diya, gore racist hote hai, stfu already, look into the mirror and clean up our own actions first, US police had every right to do so and he felt threatened by a Indian so he broke his neck, something we do ourselves in India to our own people."

2068,2068,"Alabama known as a racist state. Every country in the world respect tourist. Especially in India we try to help foreigners as much as we can, and we are very polite to those who come to our country. But look here this is so called a Christian nation. But they don't have the Christ like love or attitude towards another human being. The bible belt southern states please don't go to that place, those people are very prejudice. Here the African american suffered a lot by the white people. Most of these guys never travel and their district is their comfort zone. Unfortunately it is sad."

Yes it was excessive force but this could have been all avoided."
